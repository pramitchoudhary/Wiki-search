The [[Apple II series|Apple II]] was introduced on April 16, 1977 at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. It differed from its major rivals, the [[TRS-80]] and [[Commodore PET]], because it came with character cell based color graphics and an [[open architecture|open]] [[computer architecture|architecture]]. While early models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5&amp;nbsp;1/4&amp;nbsp;inch [[floppy disk]] drive and interface, the [[Disk II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Apple II History Chapter 4 | url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/ | author=Steven Weyhrich| date=April 21, 2002 | accessdate=August 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first &quot;[[killer application|killer app]]&quot; of the business world—the [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]] program.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemvc&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas. [http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/visicalc-origin-bricklin.html VisiCalc and the rise of the Apple II], ''Low End Mac'', September 22, 2006.

By the end of the 1970s, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The company introduced the ill-fated [[Apple III]] in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]] in the business and corporate computing market.&lt;ref&gt;Coventry, Joshua.

Jobs and several Apple employees including [[Jef Raskin]] visited [[Xerox PARC]] in December 1979 to see the [[Xerox Alto]]. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares (800,000 split-adjusted shares) of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2000/foth000918.htm|title=Fool.com: How Xerox Forfeited the PC War|work=The Motley Fool|author=Landley, Rob|date=September 18, 2000|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface ([[GUI]]), and development of a GUI began for the [[Apple Lisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.worldofapple.com/archives/2006/03/30/apple-at-30-1976-to-1986/|title=Apple at 30&amp;nbsp;– 1976 to 1986 | work=World of Apple|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Apple went public, it generated more capital than any IPO since [[Ford Motor Company]] in 1956 and instantly created more millionaires (about 300) than any company in history.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== 1981–1985: Lisa and Macintosh ===

[[File:Ad apple 1984.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Anya Major|Model]] from Apple's [[1984 (television commercial)|&quot;1984&quot; ad]], set in a [[dystopia]]n future modeled after the [[George Orwell]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', set the tone for the introduction of the Macintosh.]]
Steve Jobs began working on the [[Apple Lisa]] in 1978 but in 1982 he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting, and took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the [[Macintosh]]. A turf war broke out between Lisa's &quot;corporate shirts&quot; and Jobs' &quot;pirates&quot; over which product would ship first and save Apple. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemlisa&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the [[LaserWriter]], the first [[PostScript]] [[laser printer]] to be offered at a reasonable price, and [[PageMaker]], an early [[desktop publishing]] package. The Mac was particularly powerful in this market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/beginners/f/when_dtp.htm|title=When was desktop publishing invented?|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1986–1993: Rise and fall ===
{{See also|Timeline of Apple II family|Timeline of Macintosh models}}
[[File:Macintosh portable.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Macintosh Portable]] was Apple's first &quot;portable&quot; Macintosh computer, released in 1989.]]
Having learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky [[Macintosh Portable]] in 1989, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]] in 1991. The Macintosh Portable was designed to be just as powerful as a desktop Macintosh, but weighed {{convert|7.5|kg}} with a 12-hour battery life. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system, which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for [[Mac OS]] until 2001.

The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemsculley&quot; /&gt; For some time, it appeared that Apple could do no wrong, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine ''[[MacLife|MacAddict]]'' named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the &quot;first golden age&quot; of the Macintosh.

Following the success of the [[Macintosh LC]], Apple introduced the [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] line, a low-end [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]] offering, and the ill-fated [[Performa]] line that was sold in several confusing configurations and software bundles to avoid competing with the various consumer outlets such as [[Sears]], [[Price Club]], and [[Wal-Mart]], who were the primary dealers for these models. The result was disastrous for Apple as consumers did not understand the difference between models.&lt;ref name=&quot;vawperforma&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Macintosh Performa|url=http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html|publisher=Vectronics Apple World|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time Apple experimented with a number of other failed consumer targeted products including [[QuickTake|digital cameras]], [[PowerCD|portable CD audio players]], [[AppleDesign Powered Speakers|speakers]], [[Bandai Pippin|video consoles]], and [[Apple Interactive Television Box|TV appliances]]. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued [[Newton (platform)|Newton division]] based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Ultimately, all of this proved too-little-too-late for Apple as their market share and stock prices continued to slide.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Apple saw the [[Apple II series]] as too expensive to produce, while taking away sales from the low end Macintosh.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple2history11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html#11|title=Apple II History Chap 11|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Apple released the [[Macintosh LC]] with a single [[expansion slot]] for the [[Apple IIe Card]] to migrate Apple II users to the Macintosh platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple2history11&quot; /&gt; Apple stopped selling the [[Apple IIe]] in 1993.

Microsoft continued to gain market share with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while Apple was delivering a richly engineered, but expensive, experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Q4.06/3EC02E78-FD4D-4CDF-92A0-9C4CBDFAB3D2.html|title=1990–1995: Why the World Went Windows|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response. Instead they sued [[Microsoft]] for using a [[graphical user interface]] similar to the [[Apple Lisa]] in [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lemms&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

Retrieved on March 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed. At the same time, a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied Apple's reputation, and Sculley was replaced by [[Michael Spindler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/michael-spindler-apple.html|title=Michael Spindler: The Peter Principle at Apple|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1994–1997: Attempts at reinvention ===

[[File:Newton-IMG 0320 cleanup.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] was Apple's first foray into the [[personal digital assistant|PDA]] markets, as well as one of the first in the industry. Despite being a financial flop at the time of its release, it helped pave the way for the [[Palm Pilot]] and Apple's own [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] in the future.]]
By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as the [[A/UX]]. Apple had also begun to experiment in providing a Mac-only online portal which they called [[eWorld]], developed in collaboration with [[America Online]] and designed as a Mac-friendly alternative to other online services such as [[CompuServe]]. The Macintosh platform was itself becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking, and several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors like [[Sun Microsystems]]. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform, or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html|title=1990–1995: Hitting the Wall|accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Apple allied with IBM and [[Motorola]] in the [[AIM alliance]]. The goal was to create a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple's software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use IBM's [[PowerPC]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=6100&amp;performa=off&amp;sort=date&amp;order=ASC&amp;range=|title=Power Macintosh 6100|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Michael Spindler was replaced by [[Gil Amelio]] as CEO. Gil Amelio made many changes at Apple, including extensive layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin, Bryan.

Jobs became the interim CEO and began restructuring the company's product line.

At the 1997 [[Macworld Expo]], Steve Jobs announced that Apple would join Microsoft to release new versions of [[Microsoft Office]] for the Macintosh, and that Microsoft made a $150 million investment in non-voting Apple stock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/ca/press/1997/08/AppleMicrosoft.html Microsoft and Apple Affirm Commitment to Build Next Generation Software for Macintosh], ''Apple Inc.'', August 6, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1998–2005: Return to profitability ===

On August 15, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the [[Macintosh 128K]]: the [[iMac]].

After years of speculation and multiple rumored &quot;leaks&quot; Apple announced a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad runs the same touch based operating system that the iPhone uses and many of the same iPhone apps are compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch even with very little development time before the release.

Apple released the [[iPhone 4|fourth generation iPhone]], which introduced [[video calling]], [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]], and a new [[Electrical insulation|uninsulated]] [[stainless steel]] design, which acts as the phone's antenna.

After a large amount of media coverage including mainstream news organizations, Apple held a press conference where they offered buyers a free rubber 'bumper' case, which had been proven to eliminate the signal reduction issue.

On October 4, 2011, Apple unveiled the [[iPhone 4S]], which was released in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Japan]] on October 14, 2011, with other countries set to follow later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osxdaily.com/2011/10/05/iphone-4s-availability/|title=iPhone 4S Availability|publisher=OS X Daily|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first iPhone model to feature the [[Apple A5]] chip, as well as the first offered on the [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] network (joining [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]] and [[Verizon Wireless]] as the United States carriers offering iPhone models). On October 19, 2011, Apple announced an agreement with [[C Spire Wireless]] to sell the iPhone 4S with that carrier in the near future, marking the first time the iPhone was officially supported on a regional carrier's network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2394938,00.asp#fbid=fz8D_P_4GCf|title=Regional Carrier C Spire to Sell iPhone 4S|publisher=PC Magazine|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable feature of the iPhone 4S was [[Siri (software)|Siri]] voice assistant technology, which Apple had acquired in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/semantic-web/siri-acquired-by-apple-iphone-becomes-the-virtual-personal-assistant/371|title=Siri acquired by Apple; iPhone becomes the Virtual Personal Assistant?|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other features, including an updated 8 megapixel camera with new optics. Apple sold 4 million iPhone 4S phones in the first three days after its release, which made it not only the best iPhone launch in Apple's history, but the most-successful launch of any mobile phone ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/10/17iPhone-4S-First-Weekend-Sales-Top-Four-Million.html|title=iPhone 4S First Weekend Sales Top Four Million|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AppleTV top2.png|thumb|The Apple TV, in its most recent revision]]
At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]], (previously known as the iTV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |title=Apple Announces iTunes 7 with Amazing New Features |publisher=Apple.com |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, includes outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and plays video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09appletv.html |title=Apple TV Coming to Your Living Room |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2007 a 160 GB drive was released alongside the existing 40&amp;nbsp;GB model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30appletv.html |title=YouTube Coming to Apple TV |publisher=Apple.com |date= |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on January 15, 2008 a software update was released, which allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15appletv.html |title=Apple Introduces New Apple TV Software &amp; Lowers Price to $229 |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, alongside the release of the new line of iPod devices for the year, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of [[flash memory]] to [[cache (computing)|cache]] media downloaded. Apple with the Apple TV has added another device to its portfolio that runs on its A4 processor along with the iPad and the iPhone. The memory included in the device is the half of the [[iPhone 4]] at 256 MB; the same as the [[iPad]], [[iPhone 3GS]], [[iPod touch]] 3G, and [[iPod touch]] 4G.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/|title=Apple TV teardown reveals 8GB flash storage, 256MB RAM, leftover iPad parts|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010|publisher=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has HDMI out as the only video out source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including YouTube and Netflix, and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99.

=== Software ===
{{See also|List of Macintosh software}}
Apple develops its own [[operating system]] to run on Macs, [[Mac OS X]], the latest version being [[Mac OS X Lion]] (version 10.7). Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its Mac OS X operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundles [[iDVD]], [[iMovie]], [[iPhoto]], iTunes, [[GarageBand]], and [[iWeb]]. For presentation, page layout and word processing, [[iWork]] is available, which includes [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]], [[Pages (iWork)|Pages]], and [[Numbers (software)|Numbers]]. iTunes, [[QuickTime]] media player, [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser, and [[Software Update]] are available as free downloads for both Mac OS X and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the operating system [[Mac OS X Server]]; [[Apple Remote Desktop]], a remote systems management application; [[WebObjects]], [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]] Web [[application server]]; and [[Xsan]], a [[Storage Area Network]] file system. For the professional creative market, there is [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] for professional [[Raw image format|RAW]]-format [[photo]] processing; [[Final Cut Studio]], a video production suite; [[Logic Pro|Logic]], a comprehensive music toolkit and [[Shake (software)|Shake]], an advanced effects composition program.

Apple also offers online services with [[MobileMe]] (formerly [[.Mac]]) that bundles personal [[web page]]s, [[email]], [[social networking service|Groups]], [[iDisk]], [[backup (backup software)|backup]], [[iSync]], and Learning Center online tutorials. MobileMe is a subscription-based internet suite that capitalizes on the ability to store personal data on an online server and thereby keep all web-connected devices in sync.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.apple.com/mobileme/features/|title=Apple.com&amp;nbsp;— MobileMe&amp;nbsp;— Features|accessdate=August 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announced at MacWorld Expo 2009, [[iWork.com]] allows iWork users to upload documents for sharing and collaboration.
{{Timeline of Apple Inc. products}}

== Culture ==
=== Corporate ===

Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of what a [[corporate culture]] should look like in organizational hierarchy (flat versus tall, casual versus formal attire, etc.). Other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Microsoft]]. Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like [[IBM]] by default, thanks to the influence of its founders; Steve Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple was a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the [[1984 (television commercial)|&quot;1984&quot; TV ad]], this trait had become a key way the company attempted to differentiate itself from its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deutschman|first=Alan|title=The once and future Steve Jobs|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/|work=Salon.com|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives, each with his own idea of what Apple should be, some of its original character has arguably been lost, but Apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ, especially after Jobs' return. To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program, awarding individuals who made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including [[Bill Atkinson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzfeld&quot;&gt;[[Andy Hertzfeld|Hertzfeld, Andy]].

Numerous employees of Apple have cited that projects without Jobs' involvement often take longer than projects with his involvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;cultofmacwork&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/what-its-like-to-work-at-apple|title=What It's Like To Work At Apple|first=John|last=Brownlee|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another presents the image of Jobs &quot;wandering the hall with a [[flame thrower]] in hand, asking random people 'do you work on [[MobileMe]]?'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianworkingatapple&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jan/02/apple-macworld-lookback|title=Enjoying the show, avoiding the flamethrower: life inside Apple|first=Chuq|last=von Rospach|date=January 2, 2009|location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having best-in-class employees in every role. For instance, [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]] who was Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011, was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet he had no control the inventory in his stores (which is done company wide by then-COO and now CEO [[Tim Cook]] who has a background in supply-chain management). This is the opposite of [[General Electric]]'s corporate culture which has created well-rounded managers.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/ |title=How Apple works: Inside the world's biggest startup - Fortune Tech |publisher=Tech.fortune.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

Under the leadership of [[Tim Cook]] who joined the company in 1998 and ascended to his present position as CEO, Apple has developed an extremely efficient and effective supply chain which has been ranked as the world's best for the past four years (2007–2010). The company's manufacturing, procurement and logistics enables it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories; Apple's profit margins have been 40 percent compared with 10-20 percent for most other hardware companies in 2011. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational edge is “Nobody wants to buy sour milk”.

According to a report by the [[New York Times]], Apple insiders &quot;believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that “Made in the U.S.A.” is no longer a viable option for most Apple products&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first1=Charles | last1=Duhigg | first2=Keith | last2=Bradsher | title=Apple, America and a Squeezed Middle Class | date=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's brand's loyalty is considered unusual for any product. At one time, [[Apple evangelist]]s were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established. Apple evangelist [[Guy Kawasaki]] has called the brand fanaticism &quot;something that was stumbled upon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Huba, Jackie; McConnell, Ben. [http://www.creatingcustomerevangelists.com/resources/evangelists/guy_kawasaki.asp The father of evangelism marketing].&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has, however, supported the continuing existence of a network of [[Macintosh User Group|Mac User Groups]] in most major and many minor centers of population where Mac computers are available.

Mac users would meet at the European [[Apple Expo]] and the San Francisco [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo]] trade shows where Apple traditionally introduced new products each year to the industry and public until Apple pulled out of both events. While the conferences continue, Apple does not have official representation there. Mac developers, in turn, continue to gather at the annual Apple [[Worldwide Developers Conference]].

[[Apple Store]] openings can draw crowds of thousands, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/12/61513 |title=Apple Store: Chain of Devotion |work=Wired |author=Kahney, Leander |date=December 10, 2003 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York City [[Fifth Avenue]] &quot;Cube&quot; store had a line as long as half a mile; a few Mac fans took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/fifth_avenue/index.html |title=ifo Apple Store – Fifth Avenue Grand Opening |publisher=Ifoapplestore.com |date= |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ginza]] opening in Tokyo was estimated in the thousands with a line exceeding eight city blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple in Osaka: another huge opening|url=http://www.japanconsuming.com/news/040828.html|publisher=JapanConsuming|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080528200249/http://www.japanconsuming.com/news/040828.html|archivedate=May 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Sculley told ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper in 1997: &quot;People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company. It was the marketing company of the decade.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2002/12/56677|title=Wired News: Apple: It's All About the Brand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in 2002 by [[Nielsen Online|NetRatings]] indicate that the average Apple consumer was usually more affluent and better educated than other PC company consumers. The research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average Apple Inc. products are more expensive than other PC products.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Fried (writer)|Fried, Ian]].

During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawlor.cs.uaf.edu/~olawlor/ref/mac_ports/index.html |title=Mac Ports |publisher=Lawlor.cs.uaf.edu |date=March 17, 2001 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s beginning with Apple's adoption of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in the [[Power Macintosh 7500|7500]]/[[Power Macintosh 8500|8500]]/[[Power Macintosh 9500|9500]] [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]. Apple has since adopted [[USB]], [[AGP]], [[HyperTransport]], [[Wi-Fi]], and other industry standards in its computers and was in some cases a leader in the adoption of standards such as USB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-spec7.html |title=Standards and specs: The ins and outs of USB |publisher=IBM |date=April 26, 2005 |author=Seebach, Peter |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FireWire]] is an Apple-originated standard that has seen widespread industry adoption after it was standardized as [[IEEE 1394]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html|title=1394 Trade Association: What is 1394?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since the first Apple Store opened, Apple has sold third party accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/may/20retail.html |title=Apple Marks Second Anniversary of Retail Stores |publisher=Apple.com |date= |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows, for instance, [[Nikon]] and [[Canon (company)|Canon]] to sell their Mac-compatible digital cameras and camcorders inside the store.

Books from [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], who publishes the [[For Dummies]] series of instructional books, are a notable exception, however. The publisher's line of books were banned from Apple Stores in 2005 because Steve Jobs disagreed with their decision to publish an unauthorized Jobs biography, ''[[iCon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hafner, Katie: [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/30/technology/30apple.html Steve Jobs's Review of His Biography: Ban It], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future plans====
In 2006, Apple announced its intention to build a second campus on {{convert|50|acre|m2}} assembled from various contiguous plots (east of N Wolfe Road between Pruneridge Avenue and Vallco Parkway). Later acquisitions increased this to 175 acres. The new campus, also in Cupertino, will be about {{convert|1|mi}} east of the current campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Bay Area: Apple Inc. | work = traveldk.com | publisher = Dorling Kindersley Limited | url = http://traveldk.com/san-francisco/bay-area/member/apple-inc | accessdate =May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new campus building will be designed by [[Norman Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Apple’s New Headquarters Will Be Designed by Norman Foster Read more: Apple's New Headquarters to be Designed by Norman Foster | work=Inhabitat | url= http://inhabitat.com/apples-new-headquarters-will-be-designed-by-norman-foster/ | accessdate =June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2011, Steve Jobs gave a presentation to Cupertino City Council, detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs. The new campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employees in one central four-storied circular building (with a café for 3,000 sitting people integrated) surrounded by extensive landscape (with parking mainly underground and the rest centralized in a parking structure). There will be additional buildings such as an auditorium, R&amp;D facilities, a fitness center and a dedicated generating plant as primary source of electricity (powered by natural gas and other more environmentally sound means).

Since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 Super Bowl commercial]] to the more modern '[[Get a Mac]]' adverts, Apple has been recognized in the past for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products, though its [[Apple Inc. advertising#Criticism|advertising has been criticized]] for the claims of some more recent campaigns, particularly 2005 Power Mac ads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devproconnections.com/article/apple/bbb-tells-apple-to-halt-misleading-ads.aspx|title=BBB Tells Apple to Halt Misleading Ads}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3797261.stm|title=Apple Power Mac ads 'misleading' | work=BBC News | date=June 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2192019/asa-clears-apple-ads|title=UK watchdog clears Apple ads}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and iPhone ads in Britain.

==== Name ====
According to Steve Jobs, Apple was so named because Jobs was coming back from an apple farm, and he was on a [[fruitarian]] diet. He thought the name was &quot;fun, spirited and not intimidating&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steve Jobs bio says Apple CEO abhorred 'corrupt' execs|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/20/steve-jobs-bio.html|accessdate=21 October 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Logos ====
{{see also|U+F8FF|Typography of Apple Inc.}}
{{Comparison of Apple Inc. logos}}
Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree.

Almost immediately, though, this was replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s &quot;rainbow Apple&quot;, the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the &quot;bitten&quot; logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. While Jobs liked the logo, he insisted it be in color to humanize the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/09/60597|title=Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zlok.net/blog/2009/03/29/i-invented-the-apple-logo/|title=ZLOK Logo Design Blog: I Invented&amp;nbsp;... the Apple Logo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple logo was designed with a bite so that it wouldn't be recognized as another fruit.

This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to [[Alan Turing]], with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |title=Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising|work= The Independent |publisher=www.independent.co.uk |accessdate=September 14, 2009 | location=London | date=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://replay.web.archive.org/20050314132032/http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html|title=Archived Interview with Rob Janoff | date=March 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the designer of the logo and the company deny that there is any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Leavitt|2007|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, with the roll-out of the new iMac, Apple discontinued the rainbow theme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly identical in shape to its previous rainbow incarnation, on various products, packaging and advertising. An [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]]-themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 2001–2003, and a Glass-themed version has been used since 2003.

Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were [[The Beatles|Beatles]] fans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Moses | first = Asher | title = Who was Steve Jobs the man? | publisher = theage.com.au | url = http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/who-was-steve-jobs-the-man-20111007-1lcrx.html | accessdate =October 7, 2011 | location=Melbourne | date=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tearful memories for Apple co-founder | publisher = theage.com.au | url = http://media.theage.com.au/news/world-news/tearful-memories-for-apple-cofounder-2675550.html | accessdate =October 7, 2011 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Apple Inc. had trademark issues with [[Apple Corps|Apple Corps Ltd.]], a multimedia company started by The Beatles in 1967, involving their name and logo. This resulted in a [[Apple Corps v Apple Computer|series of lawsuits]] and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with their most recent law suit in 2007.

==== Slogans ====
{{Main|List of Apple Inc. slogans}}
Apple's first slogan, &quot;[[Byte]] into an Apple&quot;, was coined in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Apple Company| work = Operating System Documentation Project| publisher = Operating System Documentation Project| date = December 10, 2007| url = http://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/_english/fa-apple.htm| accessdate =August 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997–2002, Apple used the slogan &quot;[[Think Different]]&quot; in advertising campaigns. Although the slogan has been retired, it is still closely associated with Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinspirationroom.com/daily/2005/apple-think-different|title=Apple Think Different Campaign | work=The Inspiration Room Daily|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple also has slogans for specific product lines&amp;nbsp;— for example, &quot;iThink, therefore iMac&quot; was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wap.org/tours/macworldny/ithink.html|title=MacWorld New York: I think, therefore iMac|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Say hello to iPhone&quot; has been used in iPhone advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billday.com/2007/06/29/say-hello-to-iphone/|title=BillDay.com » Say hello to iPhone|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Hello&quot; was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, [[Newton (platform)|Newton]], iMac (&quot;hello (again)&quot;), and iPod.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/01/49652 IMac: What's in a Design, Anyway?].

==== Commercials ====

Apple's product commercials gained fame for launching musicians into stardom as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily News&quot;&gt;Farber, Jim.

== Environmental record ==
[[Greenpeace]] has campaigned against Apple on various environmental issues, including a global end-of-life take-back plan, non-recyclable hardware components and toxins within [[iPhone]] hardware.&lt;ref name=itox /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenpeace Slams iPhone|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/PCWorld/story?id=3731164|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003 Greenpeace has campaigned against Apple's chemical policies, in particular the inclusion of [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and [[brominated flame retardant|BFRs]] in their products.&lt;ref name=itox&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/apple/itox.html|title=iTox + iWaste|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 2, 2007, [[Steve Jobs]] released a report announcing plans to eliminate PVC and BFRs by the end of 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;agreenapple&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/hotnews/agreenerapple/|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;– A Greener Apple|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/tasty-apple-news-020507 Tasty news from Apple!].

In November 2011 Apple featured in [[Greenpeace]]'s Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy and how green their products are. The company ranked 4th out of 15 electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10 down from 4.9.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics |publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace praises Apple's sustainability, noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. It continues to score well on the products rating with all Apple products now being free of PVC vinyl plastic and brominated flame retardants. However, the guide criticizes Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting out any targets to reduce emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot; /&gt;

In the first edition, released in August 2006, Apple scored 2.7/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/Previous-editions/how-the-companies-line-1/|title=How the companies line up|publisher=Greenpeace International|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Climate Counts]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category &quot;Striding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecounts.org/scorecard_score.php?co=7 |title=Climate Counts scorecard |publisher=Climatecounts.org |date= |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a &quot;stuck icon&quot;, adding that Apple at the time was &quot;a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;iwclimate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/mac/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207601672|title=Environmental Group Hits Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] rates Apple highest amongst producers of notebook computers, and fairly well compared to producers of desktop computers and [[LCD displays]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macobserver.com/article/2007/01/08.6.shtml EPA Gives Apple Silver Rating on Environment] The Mac Observer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;redgreenpeace&quot;&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/1/6/6507 EPA information should make GreenPeace red-faced over Apple targeting], [[Ars Technica]].

Apple has also phased out BFRs and PVCs from various internal components.&lt;ref name=&quot;agreenapple&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;green_notebooks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/mac/green-notebooks/|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;— Mac&amp;nbsp;— Green Notebooks|year=2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/graphics.html|title=Apple: MacBook Pro Graphics|accessdate=June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple offers information about the emissions, materials, and electrical usage of each product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple – Environment – Reports|url=http://www.apple.com/environment/reports/|publisher=Apple Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, BFRs and had an efficient power adapter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple-environmental-news&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/environment/progress/|title=Apple – Environment – Environmental Progress|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Apple computers also have EPEAT Gold status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple-environmental-news&quot; /&gt;
In October 2011 Chinese authorities have ordered
an Apple supplier to close part of its

The article also reported that workers made around $100 per month and were required to live on the premises and pay for rent and food from the company, which generally amounted to a little over half of workers' earnings.&lt;ref name=&quot;wpsweatshop&quot;&gt;{{Cite document |last=Musgrove |first=Mike |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/15/AR2006061501898.html |title=Sweatshop Conditions at IPod Factory Reported |publisher=The Washington Post |date=June 16, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last=Kahney |first=Leander |url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2006/06/71138 |title=Judging Apple Sweatshop Charge |publisher=Wired |date=June 13, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: last=Jason |last=Dean |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB118677584137994489.html?mod=blog |title=The Forbidden City of Terry Gou |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 11, 2007 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Joel|title=Where the Workers Who Made Your iPhone Sleep at Night|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/11/foxconn-photo-gallery/?pid=731&amp;viewall=true|publisher=Wired|accessdate=November 13, 2010|date=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''apple''' is the [[pome|pomaceous]] [[fruit]] of the apple [[tree]], [[species]] '''''Malus domestica''''' in the rose [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Rosaceae]]). It is one of the most widely [[Tillage|cultivated]] tree fruits, and the most widely known of the many members of [[genus]] ''[[Malus]]'' that are used by humans. Apples grow on small, [[deciduous]] trees. The tree originated in [[Western Asia]], where its wild ancestor, ''[[Malus sieversii]]'', is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have been present in the mythology and religions of many cultures, including [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions.  In 2010, the fruit's [[genome]] was decoded, leading to new understandings of disease control and selective breeding in apple production. 

There are more than 7,500 known [[List of apple cultivars|cultivars]] of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including in [[cooking apple|cooking]], fresh eating and [[apple cider|cider production]]. Domestic apples are generally propagated by [[grafting]], although wild apples grow readily from seed. Trees are prone to a number of [[fungus|fungal]], [[bacterium|bacterial]] and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. 

At least 55&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of apples were grown worldwide in 2005, with a value of about $10&amp;nbsp;billion. [[People's Republic of China|China]] produced about 35% of this total. The [[United States]] is the second-leading producer, with more than 7.5% of world production. [[Iran]] is third, followed by [[Turkey]], [[Russia]], [[Italy]] and [[India]]. Apples are often eaten raw, but can also be found in many foods (especially desserts) and drinks. Many beneficial health effects have been found from eating apples; however, the seeds are slightly poisonous and two forms of allergies are seen to various proteins found in the fruit.

==Botanical information==
[[File:Koeh-108.jpg|thumb|right|Blossoms, fruits, and leaves of the apple tree (''Malus domestica'')]]
The apple forms a tree that is small and [[deciduous]], reaching {{convert|3|to|12|m|ft}} tall, with a broad, often densely twiggy crown.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;
The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[leaf arrangement|alternately arranged]] simple ovals 5 to 12&amp;nbsp;cm long and {{convert|3|-|6|cm|in}} broad on a {{convert|2|to|5|cm|in}} [[Petiole (botany)|petiole
]] with an acute tip, serrated margin and a slightly downy underside. [[Blossom]]s are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves. The flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five [[petal]]ed, and {{convert|2.5|to|3.5|cm|in}} in diameter. The fruit matures in [[autumn]], and is typically {{convert|5|to|9|cm|in}} in diameter. The center of the fruit contains five [[carpel]]s arranged in a [[Five-pointed star|five-point star]], each carpel containing one to three [[seed]]s, called [[wikt:pip|pips]].&lt;ref name=&quot;app&quot; /&gt;

===Wild ancestors===
{{Main|Malus sieversii}}
The wild [[ancestor]]s of ''Malus domestica'' are ''Malus sieversii'', found growing wild in the mountains of [[Central Asia]] in southern [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Xinjiang]], [[People's Republic of China|China]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Architecture and size relations: an essay on the apple (Malus x domestica, Rosaceae) tree&quot;/&gt; and possibly also ''[[Malus sylvestris]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coart&quot;/&gt;

===Genome===
In 2010, an Italian-led consortium announced they had decoded the complete [[genome]] of the apple, using the [[Golden delicious]] variety. It had about 57,000 genes, the highest number of any plant genome studied to date&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=83717&amp;CultureCode=en An Italian-led international research consortium decodes the apple genome] AlphaGallileo August 29, 2010. Retrieved October 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and more genes than the human genome (about 30,000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/info.shtml The Science Behind the Human Genome Project] Human Genome Project Information, US Department of Energy, March 26, 2008. Retrieved October 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This new understanding of the apple genome will help scientists in identifying genes and gene variants that contribute to disease and drought resistance and other desirable characteristics. Understanding the genes behind these characteristics will allow scientists to perform more knowledgeable selective breeding. Decoding the genome also provided proof that ''Malus sieversii'' was the wild ancestor of the domestic apple - an issue that had been long-debated in the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Brian, [http://cahnrsnews.wsu.edu/2010/08/29/apple-cup-rivals-contribute-to-apple-genome-sequencing/ Apple Cup Rivals Contribute to Apple Genome Sequencing], August 29, 2010, ''Washington State University'', retrieved October 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:95apple.jpeg|thumb|Wild ''Malus sieversii'' apple in [[Kazakhstan]]]]
The center of diversity of the genus ''Malus'' is in eastern [[Turkey]]. The apple tree was perhaps the earliest tree to be cultivated,&lt;ref name=app6/&gt; and its fruits have been improved through selection over thousands of years. [[Alexander the Great]] is credited with finding dwarfed apples in [[Kazakhstan]] in [[Asia]] in 328 [[BCE]];&lt;ref name=app/&gt; those he brought back to Macedonia might have been the progenitors of dwarfing root stocks. Winter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] for millennia, as well as in [[Argentina]] and in the [[United States]] since the [[Immigration to the United States|arrival of Europeans]].&lt;ref name=app6&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apples were brought to [[North America]] with colonists in the 17th century,&lt;ref name=app/&gt; and the first apple orchard on the North American continent was said to be near Boston in 1625. In the 20th century, irrigation projects in Washington state began and allowed the development of the multibillion dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading species.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

Until the 20th century, farmers stored apples in [[Root cellar|frostproof cellars]] during the winter for their own use or for sale. Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the necessity for storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Cultural aspects==
{{Main|Apple (symbolism)}}
[[Image:Carl Larsson Brita as Iduna.jpg|thumb|&quot;Brita as [[Iðunn|Iduna]]&quot; (1901) by [[Carl Larsson]]]]

===Germanic paganism===
In [[Norse mythology]], the goddess [[Iðunn]] is portrayed in the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' (written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) as providing apples to the [[gods]] that give them [[eternal youth]]fulness. English scholar [[H. R. Ellis Davidson]] links apples to religious practices in [[Germanic paganism]], from which [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the [[Oseberg ship]] burial site in [[Norway]], and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'') have been found in the early graves of the [[Germanic peoples]] in [[England]] and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of [[fertility]] in southwest England.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

Davidson notes a connection between apples and the [[Vanir]], a tribe of gods associated with [[fertility]] in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven &quot;golden apples&quot; being given to woo the beautiful [[Gerðr]] by [[Skírnir]], who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god [[Freyr]] in stanzas 19 and 20 of ''[[Skírnismál]]''. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' when the major goddess [[Frigg]] sends King [[Rerir]] an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a [[tumulus|mound]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DAVIDSON165-166&quot;/&gt; Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the [[Caesarean section]] birth of their son - the hero [[Völsung]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DAVIDSONROLES146-147&quot;/&gt;

Further, Davidson points out the &quot;strange&quot; phrase &quot;Apples of [[Hel (location)|Hel]]&quot; used in an 11th century poem by the [[skald]] Thorbiorn Brúnarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by the skald as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess [[Nehalennia]] is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in [[Northern Europe]] extends back to at least the time of the [[Roman Empire]] and came to Europe from the [[Near East]], the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn &quot;we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

===Greek mythology===
[[Image:Hercules Musei Capitolini MC1265 n2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Heracles]] with the apple of [[Hesperides]]]]

Apples appear in many [[World religions|religious traditions]], often as a mystical or [[forbidden fruit]]. One of the problems identifying apples in [[religion]], [[mythology]] and [[folktales]] is that the word &quot;apple&quot; was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit, other than berries, but including nuts, as late as the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;app3&quot;/&gt; For instance, in [[Greek mythology]], the [[Greek hero]] [[Heracles]], as a part of his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]], was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the [[Hesperides#The Garden of the Hesperides|Tree of Life]] growing at its center.&lt;ref name=book1&gt;{{cite book

The Greek goddess of discord, [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus ''Histories'' 6.1.191.&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed [[Kallisti|Καλλίστη]] (''Kalliste'', sometimes transliterated ''Kallisti'', 'For the most beautiful one'), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]]. [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of [[Troy]] was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of [[Sparta]]. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the [[Trojan War]].

The apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, to be sacred to Aphrodite, and to throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, J. M., trans.; rev. John M. Cooper. &quot;Epigrams&quot;. ''Plato: Complete Works''. Ed. John M. Cooper. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1997. p 1744, note to VII.

[[Atalanta]], also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but [[Hippomenes]] (a.k.a. [[Melanion]], a name possibly derived from ''melon'' the Greek word for both &quot;apple&quot; and fruit in general),&lt;ref name=book2/&gt; who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.&lt;ref name=book1/&gt;

===The forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden===
[[Image:Durer Adam and Eve.jpg|thumb|'''[[Adam and Eve]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Showcasing the apple as a symbol of sin.&lt;br /&gt;[[Albrecht Dürer]], 1507]]
Though the forbidden fruit in the [[Book of Genesis]] is not identified, popular [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition has held that it was an apple that [[Adam and Eve|Eve]] coaxed [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] to share with her.&lt;ref name=&quot;book7&quot;/&gt; This may have been the result of [[Renaissance]] painters adding elements of Greek mythology into biblical scenes (alternative interpretations also based on Greek mythology occasionally replace the apple with a pomegranate). In this case the unnamed fruit of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] became an apple under the influence of story of the [[golden apple]]s in the [[Hesperides#The Garden of the Hesperides|Garden of Hesperides]]. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. In [[Latin]], the words for &quot;apple&quot; and for &quot;[[evil]]&quot; are similar (''mālum'' &quot;an apple&quot;, ''mălum'' &quot;an evil, a misfortune&quot;). This may also have influenced the apple becoming interpreted as the [[Bible|biblical]] &quot;forbidden fruit&quot;. The [[larynx]] in the human throat has been called [[Adam's apple]] because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit sticking in the throat of Adam.&lt;ref name=&quot;book7&quot; /&gt; The apple as symbol of sexual [[seduction]] has been used to imply sexuality between men, possibly in an ironic vein.&lt;ref name=book7/&gt;

Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking ([[cooking apple]]s) or producing [[cider]].

Commercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Other desired qualities in modern commercial apple breeding are a colourful skin, absence of [[Russet apple|russeting]], ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability, high yields, disease resistance, typical '[[Red Delicious]]' apple shape, and popular flavour.&lt;ref name=&quot;England&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Old cultivars are often oddly shaped, russeted, and have a variety of textures and colours. Some find them to have a better flavour than modern cultivars,&lt;ref name=&quot;Crops &amp; Gardening - Apples of Antiquity&quot;/&gt; but may have other problems which make them commercially unviable, such as low yield, liability to disease, or poor tolerance for storage or transport. A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been kept alive by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist; apple conservation campaigns have sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction. In the [[United Kingdom]], old cultivars such as '[[Cox's Orange Pippin]]' and '[[Egremont Russet]]' are still commercially important even though by modern standards they are low yielding and disease prone.&lt;ref name=app&gt;{{cite web

==Apple production==
===Apple breeding===
{{See also|Fruit tree propagation}}
[[File:Melo Nano.JPG|300px|left|thumb|Apple pot]]
In the wild, apples grow quite readily from seeds. However, like most perennial fruits, apples are ordinarily propagated asexually by [[grafting]]. This is because seedling apples are an example of &quot;[[Zygosity|extreme heterozygotes]]&quot;, in that rather than inheriting DNA from their parents to create a new apple with those characteristics, they are instead different from their parents, sometimes radically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=[[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] and [[John Mitchinson]]|title=QI: The Complete First Series - QI Factoids|medium=DVD|publisher=2 entertain|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyploid|Triploids]] have an additional reproductive barrier in that the 3 sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids). Even in the very unusual case when a triploid plant can produce a seed (apples are an example), it happens infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/fletcher/programs/nursery/metria/metria11/ranney/index.html |title=NCSU.edu |publisher=Ces.ncsu.edu |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most new apple cultivars originate as seedlings, which either arise by chance or are bred by deliberately crossing cultivars with promising characteristics.&lt;ref name=book9/&gt; The words 'seedling', 'pippin', and 'kernel' in the name of an apple cultivar suggest that it originated as a seedling. Apples can also form [[bud sport]]s (mutations on a single branch). Some bud sports turn out to be improved strains of the parent cultivar. Some differ sufficiently from the parent tree to be considered new cultivars.&lt;ref name=app4&gt;{{cite web

The Excelsior Experiment Station of the [[University of Minnesota]] has, since the 1930s, introduced a steady progression of important hardy apples that are widely grown, both commercially and by backyard orchardists, throughout [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]]. Its most important introductions have included '[[Haralson (apple)|Haralson']] (which is the most widely cultivated apple in Minnesota), 'Wealthy', 'Honeygold', and '[[Honeycrisp]]'.

Apples have been acclimatized in [[Ecuador]] at very high altitudes, where they provide crops twice per year because of constant temperate conditions in a whole year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apples in Ecuador&quot;/&gt;

===Apple rootstocks===
{{See also|Malling series}}
[[Rootstocks]] used to control tree size have been used in apple cultivation for over 2,000 years. Dwarfing rootstocks were probably discovered by chance in Asia. Alexander the Great sent samples of dwarf apple trees back to his teacher, Aristotle, in Greece. They were maintained at the Lyceum, a center of learning in Greece.

Most modern apple rootstocks were bred in the 20th century. Much research into the existing rootstocks was begun at the [[East Malling Research Station]] in Kent, England. Following that research, Malling worked with the John Innes Institute and Long Ashton to produce a series of different rootstocks with disease resistance and a range of different sizes, which have been used all over the world.

===Pollination===
{{See also| Fruit tree pollination}}
[[Image:Apple tree blossom.JPG|right|thumb|Apple blossom from an old [[Ayrshire]] variety]]
[[Image:Orchmason.jpg|thumb|[[Orchard mason bee]] on apple bloom, [[British Columbia, Canada]]]]

Apples are self-incompatible; they must [[Pollination|cross-pollinate]] to develop fruit. During the flowering each season, apple growers usually provide [[pollinator]]s to carry the pollen. [[Honey bee]]s are most commonly used. [[Megachilidae|Orchard mason bees]] are also used as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. [[Bumblebee]] [[queen bee|queens]] are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in enough quantity to be significant pollinators.&lt;ref name=app4/&gt;

There are four to seven pollination groups in apples, depending on climate:
* Group A – Early flowering, May 1 to 3 in England ([[Gravenstein]], Red Astrachan)
* Group B – May 4 to 7 ([[Idared]], [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]])
* Group C – Mid-season flowering, May 8 to 11 ([[Granny Smith]], [[Cox's Orange Pippin]])

One cultivar can be pollinated by a compatible cultivar from the same group or close (A with A, or A with B, but not A with C or D).&lt;ref name=&quot;Symposium on Growth Regulators in Fruit Production&quot;/&gt;

Varieties are sometimes classed as to the day of peak bloom in the average 30 day blossom period, with pollinizers selected from varieties within a 6 day overlap period.

===Maturation and harvest===
{{See also|Fruit picking|Fruit tree pruning}}

Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Some cultivars, if left unpruned, will grow very large, which allows them to bear much more fruit, but makes harvesting very difficult. Mature trees typically bear {{convert|40|-|200|kg|lb}} of apples each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor years. Apples are harvested using three-point ladders that are designed to fit amongst the branches. Dwarf trees will bear about {{convert|10|-|80|kg|lb}} of fruit per year.&lt;ref name=app4/&gt;

===Storage===
Commercially, apples can be stored for some months in controlled-atmosphere chambers to delay [[ethylene]]-induced onset of ripening. The apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations of [[carbon dioxide]] and high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from moving too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For home storage, most varieties of apple can be held for approximately two weeks when kept at the coolest part of the refrigerator (i.e. below 5&amp;nbsp;°C). Some types, including the [[Granny Smith]] and [[Fuji (apple)|Fuji]], can be stored up to a year without significant degrade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Food Science Australia Fact Sheet: Refrigerated storage of perishable foods&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yepsen 1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Yepsen|first=Roger|title=Apples|year=1994|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|location=New York|isbn=0-393-03690-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pests and diseases===
[[Image:Apple tree leaves with insect damage.jpg|thumb|Leaves with significant [[insect]] damage]]
{{Main|List of apple diseases}}
{{See also|List of Lepidoptera that feed on apple trees}}
The trees are susceptible to a number of [[fungus|fungal]] and [[bacterium|bacterial]] diseases and [[insect]] pests. Many commercial orchards pursue an aggressive program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. A trend in orchard management is the use of organic methods. These use a less aggressive and direct methods of conventional farming. Instead of spraying potent chemicals, often shown to be potentially dangerous and maleficent to the tree in the long run, [[organic farming|organic]] methods include encouraging or discouraging certain cycles and pests.
To control a specific pest, organic growers might encourage the prosperity of its natural predator instead of outright killing it, and with it the natural biochemistry around the tree. Organic apples generally have the same or greater taste than conventionally grown apples, with reduced cosmetic appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Modeling and Simulation: Proceedings of the Annual Pittsburgh Conference&quot;/&gt;

A wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant; three of the more common diseases/pests are mildew, aphids and apple scab.
*[[Mildew]]: which is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring. The flowers will turn a creamy yellow colour and will not develop correctly. This can be treated in a manner not dissimilar from treating [[Botryotinia|Botrytis]]; eliminating the conditions which caused the disease in the first place and burning the infected plants are among the recommended actions to take.&lt;ref name=&quot;pest4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=pest4/&gt;

*[[Aphids]]: There are five species of aphids commonly found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by their colour, the time of year when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids.&lt;ref name=pest4/&gt; Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.&lt;ref name=pest5&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Apple scab]]: Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also develops similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple leaves on the ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;{{cite book|title=The Organic Gardener's Handbook of Natural Pest and Disease Control|editor=Bradley, Fern Marshall; Ellis, Barbara W.; Martin, Deborah L.|year=2009|publisher=Rodale, Inc|isbn=9781605296777|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the most serious disease problems are [[fireblight]], a bacterial disease; and ''[[Gymnosporangium]]'' rust, and [[Black Spot (disease)|black spot]], two fungal diseases.&lt;ref name=pest5/&gt; [[Codling moth]]s and [[apple maggot]]s are two other pests which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt;

==Human consumption==
[[Image:Apples supermarket.jpg|Different kinds of apple [[List of apple cultivars|cultivars]] in a supermarket|thumb|right]]
{{See also| Cooking apple|Cider apple}}
Apples are often eaten raw; except for the seeds, which are slightly poisonous (see below), the whole fruit including the skin is suitable for human consumption. Varieties bred for this purpose are termed dessert or [[table apple]]s.

Apples can be canned or juiced. They are milled to produce [[apple cider]] (non-alcoholic, sweet cider) and filtered for [[apple juice]]. The juice can be [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to make [[cider]] (alcoholic, hard cider), [[ciderkin]], and [[vinegar]]. Through [[distillation]], various [[alcoholic beverages]] can be produced, such as [[applejack (beverage)|applejack]], [[Calvados (spirit)|Calvados]],&lt;ref name=food/&gt; and [[apfelwein]]. [[Pectin]] and [[apple seed oil]] may also be produced.

Apples are an important ingredient in many [[dessert]]s, such as [[apple pie]], apple [[crumble]], [[apple crisp]] and [[apple cake]]. They are often eaten [[baked]] or [[stewed]], and they can also be dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. Puréed apples are generally known as [[apple sauce]]. Apples are also made into [[apple butter]] and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.
*In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], a [[toffee apple]] is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot [[toffee]] and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the US are [[candy apple]]s (coated in a hard shell of crystallised sugar syrup), and [[caramel apples]], coated with cooled [[caramel]].
*Apples are eaten with honey at the Jewish New Year of [[Rosh Hashanah]] to symbolize a sweet new year.&lt;ref name=food/&gt;
*Farms with apple orchards may open them to the public, so consumers may themselves pick the apples they will buy.&lt;ref name=food&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sliced apples turn brown with exposure to air due to the conversion of natural phenolic substances into [[melanin]] upon exposure to [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=J1/&gt; Different cultivars vary in their propensity to brown after slicing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/science/23qna.html?ref=science The Brown Apple]. // The New York Times, 22.11.2010&lt;/ref&gt; Sliced fruit can be treated with [[acidulated water]] to prevent this effect.&lt;ref name=J1/&gt;&lt;!-- NO mention melanin oxidation or acidualated water in this referenced article --&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organic production is difficult in Europe, though a few orchards have done so with commercial success,&lt;ref name=organic/&gt; using disease-resistant cultivars and the very best cultural controls. The latest tool in the organic repertoire is a spray of a light coating of [[kaolin]] clay, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, and also helps prevent apple sun scald.&lt;ref name=app4/&gt;&lt;ref name=organic/&gt;

===Apple allergy===
One form of apple allergy, often found in northern Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people who are also allergic to [[birch]] [[pollen]]. The allergy is caused by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also become allergic to other fruits, nuts and vegetables. Reactions, which are called [[oral allergy syndrome]] (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat,&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; but in rare cases can also include life-threatening [[anaphylaxis]].&lt;ref&gt;Landau, Elizabeth, [http://articles.cnn.com/2009-04-08/health/oral.allergy.syndrome_1_allergy-shots-pollen-allergies-oral-allergy-syndrome?_s=PM:HEALTH Oral allergy syndrome may explain mysterious reactions], April 8, 2009, ''CNN Health'', accessed October 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed - the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.&lt;ref name=EU&gt;[http://foodallergens.ifr.ac.uk/food.lasso?selected_food=2#summary General Information - Apple], ''Informall'', accessed October 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In other areas, such as the Mediterranean, people have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches, including a close relationship between the allergens of the two fruits. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and [[urticaria]], and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals cannot eat either raw or cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have the highest levels of the protein that causes this reaction.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;

Breeding efforts have yet to produce a hypoallergenic fruit for either of the two types of apple allergy.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;

The '''Apple II series''' ([[trademark]]ed with square brackets as &quot;Apple ][&quot;) is a set of [[8-bit]] [[home computer]]s, one of the first highly successful mass-produced [[microcomputer]] products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |url=http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/total-share.ars/4 |title=Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=December 14, 2005 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed primarily by [[Steve Wozniak]], manufactured by Apple Computer (now [[Apple Inc.]]) and introduced in 1977 with the [[Apple II|original Apple II]]. In terms of ease of use, features and expandability the Apple II was a major technological advancement over its predecessor, the [[Apple I]], a limited-production bare [[circuit board]] computer for electronics hobbyists that pioneered many features that made the Apple II a commercial success. Introduced at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]] in 1977, the Apple II was among the first successful personal computers; it launched the Apple company into a successful business (and allowed several related companies to start). Throughout the years, a number of models were sold, with the most popular model remaining relatively little changed into the 1990s. By the end of production in 1993, somewhere between five and six million Apple II series computers (including about 1.25&amp;nbsp;million Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; models)&lt;!-- Cites:  - the previous entry claimed only 2 million Apple II-line machines had been produced total, which is incorrect (in fact Apple surpassed 2&amp;nbsp;million Apple II sales in 1984) --&gt; had been produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Forster|first=Winnie|authorlink=Winnie Forster|title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds &amp; home computers 1972–2005|year=2005|publisher=GAMEPLAN|isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apple II became one of several recognizable and successful computers during the 1980s and early 1990s, although this was mainly limited to the USA. It was aggressively marketed through volume discounts and manufacturing arrangements to educational institutions which made it the first computer in widespread use in American secondary schools. The effort to develop educational and business software for the Apple II, including the 1979 release of the popular [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]], made the computer especially popular with business users and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple II Biography|url=http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=6|author=Chris Cavanaugh|date=May 2004| accessdate=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple II: The World Catches On|url= http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2009/07/apple-ii-the-world-catches-on/|author=Wilson Rothman|date= July 19, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Spreadsheet|url= http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa010199.htm|author=Mary Bellis|accessdate=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Apple II [[operating system]] was contained in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] along with [[Integer BASIC]]. Programs were entered, then saved and loaded on cassette tape. When the [[Disk II]] was implemented in 1978 by Steve Wozniak, a Disk Operating System or DOS was commissioned. The final and most popular version of this software was [[Apple DOS]] 3.3. Some commercial Apple II software booted directly and did not use standard DOS formats. This discouraged the copying or modifying of the software on the disks and improved loading speed. Apple DOS was superseded by [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], which supported a hierarchical filesystem and larger storage devices. With an optional third-party [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]-based [[expansion card]]&lt;ref name=z80&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[InfoWorld]]|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group|date=February 6, 1984| issue=Vol. 6, Num. 6|quote=Several manufacturers, however, make Z80 coprocessor boards that plug into the Apple II.|page=64|title=Review: Premium Softcard IIe|last=Petersen|first=Marty}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Apple II could boot into the [[CP/M]] operating system and run [[WordStar]], [[dBase II]], and other CP/M software. At the height of its evolution, towards the late 1980s, the platform had the graphical look of a hybrid of the Apple II and [[Macintosh]] with the introduction of the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. By 1992, the platform had [[16-bit]] processing capabilities, a mouse-driven [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]], and graphics and sound capabilities far beyond the original.

Despite the introduction of the Motorola 68000-based [[Apple Lisa]] system in 1983, and its more successful cousin the [[Macintosh]] in 1984, the relatively unsophisticated Apple II series was Apple's primary revenue source for most of the following decade. At its peak, it was a billion-dollar-a-year industry with its associated community of third-party developers and retailers. The Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; was sold until the end of 1992; the last II-series Apple in production, the IIe, was discontinued on October 15, 1993.

==Design==
The Apple II was designed to look more like a [[Small appliance|home appliance]] than a piece of electronic equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Helmer, Carl, &quot;An Apple to Byte,&quot; Byte, March 1978, p. 18-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The lid popped off the beige plastic case without the use of tools, allowing access to the computer's internals, including the [[motherboard]] (logic board in Apple lingo) with eight [[expansion slot]]s, and an array of random access memory (RAM) sockets that could hold up to 48&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte]]s worth of memory chips.

The Apple II had color and high-resolution [[Apple II graphics|graphics modes]], sound capabilities and one of two built-in [[BASIC]] programming languages (initially [[Integer BASIC]], later [[Applesoft BASIC]]). The Apple II was targeted for the masses rather than just hobbyists and engineers; it also influenced most of the microcomputers that followed it. Unlike preceding home microcomputers, it was sold as a finished consumer appliance rather than as a kit (unassembled or preassembled). ''VanLOVEs Apple Handbook'' and ''The Apple Educators Guide'' by Gerald VanDiver and Rolland Love reviewed more than 1,500 software programs that the Apple II series could use. The Apple dealer network used this book to emphasize the growing software developer base in education and personal use. &lt;!-- What does this mean?? : &quot;The books became part of the Apple program and became the first book on database.&quot; What Apple program? What about a database? --&gt;

The Apple II series had a keyboard built into the motherboard shell, with the exception of the [[Apple IIGS|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]] which featured an external keyboard. An upgrade kit was sold later to house the motherboard of an Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; in an [[Apple IIe]] case.

==Models==
{{See also|Timeline of computing}}

Early II-series models were usually designated &quot;Apple ][&quot;; later models &quot;Apple //&quot;, plus a letter suffix.

===Apple II===
[[File:Micromodem II in Apple II.jpg|thumb|250px|An Apple II computer with an external [[modem]]]]
The first Apple II computers went on sale on June 5, 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=June 5, 1977: From a Little Apple a Mighty Industry Grows|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/06/dayintech_0605|date=June 5, 2007|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] microprocessor running at 1&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]], 4 KB of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], an [[compact audio cassette#Data recording|audio cassette]] interface for loading programs and storing data, and the [[Integer BASIC]] programming language built into the [[read-only memory|ROMs]]. The video controller displayed 24 lines by 40 columns of monochrome, upper-case-only (the original character set matches ASCII characters 0x20 to 0x5F) text on the screen, with [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] [[composite video]] output suitable for display on a TV monitor, or on a regular TV set by way of a separate [[RF modulator]]. The original retail price of the computer was US$1298&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster| first=Winnie|authorlink=Winnie Forster|title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds &amp; home computers 1972–2005|year=2005|publisher=GAMEPLAN|isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with 4&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM) and US$2638 (with the maximum 48&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM). To reflect the computer's character cell [[Apple II graphics|color graphics]] capability, the Apple logo on the casing was represented using rainbow stripes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple II History Chapter 4|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04.html|author=Steven Weyhrich|date=April 21, 2002|accessdate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998. The earliest Apple IIs were assembled in [[Silicon Valley]], and later in Texas;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frank|last=Rose|title=West of Eden |publisher=Arrow Books|year=1989|page=3|isbn=0-09-976200-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[printed circuit board]]s were manufactured in Ireland and [[Singapore]].

An external 5¼-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the [[Disk II]], attached via a controller card that plugged into one of the computer's expansion slots (usually slot 6), was used for data storage and retrieval to replace cassettes. The Disk II interface, created by [[Steve Wozniak]], was regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Apple II History Chapter 5, The Disk II|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html| author=Steven Weyhrich|date=December 28, 2001|accessdate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freiberger, Paul, and Michael Swaine. &quot;Fire In The Valley, Part Two (Book Excerpt)&quot;, A+ Magazine, January 1985: 45.&lt;/ref&gt; While other controllers had dozens of chips for synchronizing data I/O with disk rotation, seeking the head to the appropriate track, and encoding the data into magnetic pulses, Wozniak's controller card had few chips; instead, the [[Apple DOS]] used software to perform these functions. The [[Group Code Recording]] used by the controller was simpler and easier to implement in software than the more common [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]]. In the end, the low chip count of the controller helped make Apple's Disk II the first affordable floppy drive for personal computers. As a side effect, Wozniak's scheme made it easy for [[proprietary software]] developers to [[copy protection|copy-protect]] the media on which their software shipped by changing the low-level sector format or stepping the drive's head between the tracks; inevitably, other companies eventually sold software to foil this protection. Another Wozniak optimization allowed him to omit Shugart's Track-0 sensor. When the Operating System wants to go to track 0, the controller simply moves 40 times toward the next-lower-numbered track, relying on the mechanical stop to prevent it going any further down than track 0. This process, called &quot;recalibration&quot;, made a loud buzzing (rapid mechanical chattering) sound that often frightened Apple novices.

The approach taken in the Disk II controller was typical of Wozniak's design sensibility. The Apple II used several engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs. For example, taking advantage of the way that 6502 instructions only access memory every other clock cycle, the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise unused cycles avoided memory contention issues and also eliminated the need for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips. Rather than use a complex analog-to-digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period was proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.

The text and graphics screens had a complex arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which was reputedly due to Wozniak's realization that doing it that way would save a chip; it was less expensive to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline than to include the extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color was determined by pixel position and could thus be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for sub-pixel [[font]] rendering since orange and blue pixels appeared half a pixel-width further to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson |first=Steve|title=The origins of sub-pixel font rendering|url=http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm|accessdate=August 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Color on the Apple II series took advantage of a quirk of the [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC television signal specification was black-and-white. Color was tacked on later by adding a 3.58-MHz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by B&amp;W TV sets. Color is encoded based on the ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'' of this signal in relation to a reference ''[[color burst]]'' signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into ''[[pixel]]s'' on the computer screen.

The Apple II display provided two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal was turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it could display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Later, blue and orange became available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the colorburst signal. The high-resolution display offered more colors simply by compressing more, narrower pixels into each subcarrier cycle. The coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode worked differently, as it could output a short burst of high-frequency signal per pixel to offer more color options.

The epitome of the Apple II design philosophy was the Apple II sound circuitry. Rather than having a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II had a toggle circuit that could only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two, three and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) were generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Not for nearly a decade would an Apple II be released with a dedicated sound chip (though with six expansion slots, users could add sound functionality via a soundcard like the [[Mockingboard]]). Similar techniques were used for cassette storage: the cassette output worked the same as the speaker, and the input was a simple [[Zero crossing threshold detector|zero-crossing detector]] that served as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM were used to encode and decode data in [[frequency-shift keying]] for the cassette. Since the Apple II mainboard had no interrupts, it was impossible to use the speaker without taking CPU time and so most games had little sound.

Wozniak's open design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including [[Apple II peripheral cards]] such as [[Apple II serial cards|Serial controllers]], display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, and networking components. There were plug-in [[expansion card]]s – such as the ''Z80-card''&lt;ref name=z80/&gt; – that permitted the Apple to use the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and run a multitude of programs developed under the [[CP/M]] operating system,&lt;ref name=&quot;z80&quot;/&gt; including the [[dBase|dBase II]] database and the [[WordStar]] word processor. There was also a third-party [[Motorola 6809|6809]] card that would allow [[OS-9]] Level One to be run. The [[Mockingboard]] sound card greatly improved audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. Eventually, [[Apple II accelerators|Apple II accelerator cards]] were created to double or quadruple the computer's speed.

The original Apple II was discontinued at the start of 1981, having been superseded by the II+. An estimated 40,000 machines were sold for its 4-year production run.

===Apple II Plus===
 {{Main|Apple II Plus}}
[[File:Apple II Plus.jpg|thumb|right|Apple II Plus]]
The '''Apple II Plus''', introduced in June 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah06.html|title=Apple II History Chap 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/05/0509.html|title=Macintosh Prehistory: The Apple I and Apple II Era}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/products.html|title=Apple Products}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lrs.ed.uiuc.edu/students/madkins/timeline.html|title=EDTechTimeline}}&lt;/ref&gt; included the [[Applesoft BASIC]] programming language in [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. This [[Microsoft]]-authored dialect of BASIC, which was previously available as an upgrade, supported floating-point arithmetic, and became the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple II series (though it ran at a noticeably slower speed than Steve Wozniak's Integer BASIC).

Except for improved graphics and disk-booting support in the ROM, the II+ was otherwise identical to the original II. RAM prices fell during 1980-81 and all II+ machines came from the factory with a full 48k of memory already installed. The language card in Slot 0 added another 16k, but it had to be [[bank switch]]ed since the remaining CPU address space was occupied by the ROMs and I/O area. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3's INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. The language card was also required to use the [[UCSD Pascal]] and [[FORTRAN|FORTRAN 77]] compilers, which were released by Apple at about the same time. These ran under the [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]] operating system, which had its own disk format and emitted code for a &quot;virtual machine&quot; rather than the actual 6502 processor.
The UCSD P-system had a curious approach to [[memory management]], which became even more curious on the [[Apple III]].

A [[TEMPEST]] approved version of the Apple II Plus called the Microfix was developed in 1980 by the [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]] for [[U.S. Army]] [[FORSCOM]]. Fielded in 1982, the Microfix system was the first tactical system using video disk ([[Laserdisk]]) map technology providing zoom and scroll over map imagery coupled with a point database of intelligence data such as [[order of battle]], airfields, roadways, and bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://training.esri.com/campus/library/Bibliography/RecordDetail.cfm?ID=16159|title=The development of small computer geographic analysis systems for military applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.falconview.org/trac/FalconView/raw-attachment/wiki/Presentations/Moving_Maps.pdf|title= Moving Maps: Evolution in GIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm34_3.pdf|title=U.S. Army Field Manual 34-3, Intelligence Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple II Europlus and J-Plus===
[[File:Apple II J-Plus.jpg|thumb|Apple II J-Plus]]
After the success of the first Apple II in the United States, Apple expanded its market to include Europe, Australia and the Far East in 1978, with the '''Apple II Europlus''' (Europe, Australia) and the '''Apple II J-Plus''' (Japan). In these models, Apple made the necessary hardware, software and [[firmware]] changes in order to comply to standards outside of the U.S. The [[power supply]] was modified to accept the local voltage, and in the European and Australian model the video output signal was changed from color [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] to monochrome [[Phase Alternating Line|PAL]] – an extra video card was needed for color PAL graphics, since the simple tricks Wozniak had used to generate a pseudo-NTSC signal with minimal hardware did not carry over to the more complex PAL system. In the Japanese version of the international Apple, the keyboard layout was changed to allow for [[Katakana]] writing (full [[Kanji]] support was clearly beyond the capabilities of the machine), but in most other countries the international Apple was sold with an unmodified American keyboard; thus the German model still lacked the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlauts]], for example. For the most part, the Apple II Europlus and J-Plus were identical to the Apple II Plus. Production of the Europlus ended in 1983.

===Apple IIe===
{{Main|Apple IIe}}
[[Image:Apple iie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Apple IIe with DuoDisk and Monitor //.]]

The Apple II Plus was followed in 1983 by the '''[[Apple IIe]]''', a cost-reduced yet more powerful machine that used newer chips to reduce the component count and add new features, such as the display of upper and lowercase letters and a standard 64&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM.

The IIe RAM was configured as if it were a 48&amp;nbsp;kB Apple II Plus with a language card; the machine had no slot 0, but instead had an auxiliary slot that for most practical purposes took the place of slot 3, the most commonly used slot for 80-column cards in the II Plus.

The auxiliary slot could accept a 1&amp;nbsp;kB memory card to enable the 80-column display. This card contained only RAM; the hardware and firmware for the 80-column display was built into the Apple IIe, remaining fairly compatible with the older Videx-style cards, even though the low-level details were very different. An &quot;extended 80-column card&quot; with more memory expanded the machine's RAM to 128&amp;nbsp;kB.

As with the language card, the memory in the 80-column card was bank-switched over the machine's main RAM; this made the memory better suited to data storage than to running software, and in fact the [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]] operating system, which was introduced with the Apple IIe, would automatically configure this memory as a [[RAM disk]] upon booting.

Third-party aux-slot memory cards later allowed expansion up to 1&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]]. The {{nowrap|1 K}} 80-column card also enabled one new graphics mode, Double Lo-Res (80×48 pixels). The extended 80-column card enabled two, Double Lo-Res and Double Hi-Res (560×192 pixels). Both modes doubled the horizontal resolution in comparison to the standard Lo-Res (40×48) and Hi-Res (280×192) Modes; in the case of Double Hi-Res, the number of available colors was increased as well, from 6 to 15. Apple IIes from the very first production run could not use Double Hi-Res. Neither of these modes was directly supported by the built-in BASIC, however, so the user had to resort to the use of lots of POKE and CALL commands in BASIC, or assembly language programming, or one of a number of software Toolkits to exploit these modes.

While it was possible for software to switch out the 80-column firmware, making the firmware of a card in slot 3 available with a card in the auxiliary slot, it was not a common thing to do. However, even with the 80-column firmware enabled, slot 3's I/O memory range was still usable, giving it approximately the capability of slot 0 on a II or II plus. This meant that it actually was possible to use slot 3 for things, such as coprocessor cards and language cards, that did not use slot firmware space.

Introduced with the IIe was the DuoDisk, essentially two Disk II 5.25-inch drives in a single enclosure designed to stack between the computer and the monitor, and a new controller card to run it. This controller was (by design) functionally identical to the original Disk II controller but used a different connector, allowing a single cable to control both drives in the DuoDisk. The DuoDisk was plagued by reliability problems, however, and did not catch on as well as the Apple IIe itself.

The Apple IIe was the most popular Apple II ever built and was widely considered the &quot;workhorse&quot; of the line. It also has the distinction of being the longest-lived Apple computer of all time – it was manufactured and sold with only minor changes for nearly 11 years. In that time, following the original, two important variations were introduced known as the [[Apple IIe#The Enhanced IIe|Enhanced IIe]] (four new replacement chips to give it some of the features of the later model [[Apple IIc]], including an upgraded processor called the 65C02) and the [[Apple IIe Platinum|Platinum IIe]] (a modernized new look for the case color to match other Apple products of the era, along with the addition of a built-in numeric keypad). An Enhanced IIe with 128&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM can be considered the minimum requirement for running most Apple II software released after about 1988. //e models were distinguished from the standard IIe by having 128k of memory, DHGR graphics mode, and a 65C02 CPU.

Two and a half years before the Apple IIe, Apple had produced and marketed a computer called the ''[[Apple III]]'' for business users. This product was not a success, and Steve Wozniak has been quoted as saying that the Apple III had a 100% failure rate – every single machine manufactured had some kind of fault (a famous Apple technical bulletin recommended dropping the machine vertically onto a table to re-seat the DIP chips in their loose sockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Linzmayer |first=Owen W. |title=Apple Confidential 2.0: The Definitive History of the World's Most Colorful Company |pages=41–43 |isbn=1593270100 |publisher=[[No Starch Press]] |year=2004 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mXnw5tM8QRwC |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many of its features were carried over in the design of the Apple IIe, without the manufacturing flaws that led to failures in the Apple III. Among them was the ProDOS operating system, which was based on Apple III's Sophisticated Operating System (SOS).

===Apple IIc===
{{Main|Apple IIc}}
[[Image:Apple iicb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Apple IIc was Apple's first compact and portable computer.]]

Apple released the '''[[Apple IIc]]''' in April 1984, billing it as a portable Apple II, because it could be easily carried, though unlike modern [[portable computer|portables]] it lacked a built-in display and battery. The IIc even sported a carrying handle that folded down to prop the machine up into a typing position. It was the first of three Apple II models to be made in the [[Snow White design language]], and the only one that used its unique creamy off-white color.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kunkel, Paul, AppleDesign: The work of the Apple Industrial Design Group, with photographs by Rick English, New York: Graphis, 1997, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; (The other Snow White computers from the Apple II series, the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; and the IIc Plus, were light gray, called &quot;Platinum&quot; by Apple.) The obsolete cassette port was omitted from the IIc and it could not boot directly into BASIC if there was no disk inserted.

The Apple IIc was the first Apple II to use the [[WDC 65C02|65C02]] low-power variant of the 6502 processor, and featured a built-in 5.25-inch floppy drive and 128&amp;nbsp;kB RAM, with a built-in disk controller that could control external drives, composite video (NTSC or PAL), serial interfaces for modem and printer, and a port usable by either a joystick or mouse. Unlike previous Apple II models, the IIc had no internal expansion slots at all, this being the means by which its compact size was attained. Third parties did eventually figure out how to wedge up to 1&amp;nbsp;MB of additional memory and a real-time clock into the machine, and a later revision of the motherboard provided an expansion slot that could accept an Apple memory card bearing up to 1&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM. The disk port, originally intended for a second 5.25-inch floppy drive, eventually was able to interface to 3½-inch disk drives and (via third parties) even hard disks.

IIc machines supported the 16 color DHGR graphics mode and from a software standpoint were identical to the //e.

To play up the portability, two different monochrome [[LCD]] displays were sold for use with the IIc's video expansion port, although both were short-lived due to high cost and poor legibility. (An Apple IIc with the smaller of these displays appeared briefly in the film ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]''.) The IIc had an external power supply that converted AC power to 12&amp;nbsp;V DC, allowing third parties to offer battery packs and automobile power adapters that connected in place of the supplied AC adapter.

The Apple IIc (in its American version) was the first microcomputer to include support for the [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard]], which was activated using a switch above the keyboard. This feature was also later found in late-model American Apple IIe computers (though the switch was inside the computer) and in the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; (accessible via the built-in control panel). The international models used the same mechanism to switch between the localized and the American keyboard layouts, but did not offer Dvorak.

===Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;===
{{Main|Apple IIGS}}
[[Image:Apple IIGS.jpg|right|thumb|150|The Apple IIGS, the most powerful Apple II, featuring a true 16-bit CPU, 4096 colors, Ensoniq synthesizer, a Mac-like GUI and a mouse.]]
[[Image:Apple iigs.jpg|right|thumb|150|The Apple IIGS setup, with keyboard and mouse shown.]]

The next member of the line was the '''[[Apple IIGS|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]]''' computer, released on September 15, 1986. A radical departure from the existing Apple II line, the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; featured a true [[16-bit]] microprocessor, the [[WDC 65816/65802|65C816]], operating at {{nowrap|2.8&amp;nbsp;MHz}} with 24-bit addressing, allowing expansion up to 8&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM without the bank-switching hassles of the earlier machines (RAM cards with more than 4&amp;nbsp;MB were never directly supported by Apple&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Joe. ''A2Pro Roundtable'', October 1991, Category 16, Topic 2.&lt;/ref&gt;). It introduced two completely new graphic modes sporting higher resolutions and a palette of 4,096 colors; however, only 4 (at 640×200 resolution) or 16 (at 320×200 resolution) colors could be used on a single line at a time, although a technique known as ''[[dither]]ing'' was often employed in software to increase the number of perceived colors.&lt;ref name=&quot;making&quot;&gt;Duprau, Jeanne, and Tyson, Molly. &quot;The Making of the Apple IIGS&quot;, ''A+ Magazine'', November 1986: 57–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a departure from earlier Apple II graphics modes, the new modes laid out the scanlines sequentially in memory. However, programmers in search of a graphics challenge could always turn to 3200-color mode, which involved precisely swapping in a different 16-color palette for each of the screen's 200 scanlines as the monitor's electron beam traced the screen line by line. This exotic technique did not leave many CPU cycles available for other processing, so this &quot;mode&quot; was best suited to displaying static images.

The Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; stood out from any previous (or future) Apple II models, evolving and advancing the platform into the next generation of computing while still maintaining near-complete backward compatibility. The secret of the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;'s compatibility was a single chip called the [[Mega II]], which contained the functional equivalent of an entire Apple IIe computer (sans processor). This, combined with the flawless 65C02 emulation mode of the 65C816 processor, provided full support for legacy software.

The computer also included a 32-voice [[Ensoniq]] [[Ensoniq 5503|5503]], '[[wavetable synthesis|wavetable']] [[sample-based synthesis|sample-based music synthesizer]] chip with 64&amp;nbsp;kB dedicated RAM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple IIGS|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=71|author=Old-Computers.com Museum|accessdate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 256&amp;nbsp;kB of standard RAM, built-in peripheral ports (switchable between IIe-style card slots and IIc-style onboard controllers for disk drives, mouse, RGB video, and serial devices), built-in [[AppleTalk]] networking, and a ROM toolbox that supported a graphical user interface derived from the Macintosh toolbox. The computer could run existing 8-bit Apple II software (including software written for the very first Apple II in Integer BASIC), but also supported 16-bit software running under a new OS first called ProDOS 16 and later called GS/OS.&lt;ref name=&quot;making&quot;/&gt; The new OS eventually included a Finder that could be used for managing disks and files and opening documents and applications, along with desk accessories – just like the Macintosh. The 16-bit operating system would automatically switch to the text display and downshift to 8-bit mode to run legacy software, while offering a consistent, Macintosh-like graphical interface for native 16-bit applications. Eventually, the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; gained the ability to read and write Macintosh disks and, through third-party software, even multitasking (both cooperative and preemptive, the latter in the form of a Unix-type shell), outline TrueType font support, and in one case, even real-time 3D gaming using texture mapping.

The first 50,000 Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; computers came with Steve Wozniak's &quot;''Woz''&quot; signature silkscreened on the front and were referred to as the &quot;''Woz Limited Edition''&quot;. These machines are not functionally different from machines from the same time period without the signature.

===Apple IIc Plus===
{{Main|Apple IIc Plus}}
[[Image:Apple IIc Plus (front).jpg|thumb|right|The Apple IIc Plus, an 8-bit revision of the original portable but with faster CPU, 3.5-inch floppy and built-in power supply. It was the last introduced of the Apple II line.]]

The final Apple II model was the '''[[Apple IIc Plus]]''' introduced in 1988. It was the same size and shape as the IIc that came before it, but the 5.25-inch floppy drive had been replaced with a 3½-inch drive, the power supply was moved inside (gone was the IIc's &quot;brick on a leash&quot; power supply), and the processor was a fast {{nowrap|4&amp;nbsp;MHz}} 65C02 processor that actually ran 8-bit Apple II software faster than the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. (Third-party accelerators for other models could, however, go as fast as {{nowrap|10&amp;nbsp;MHz}}, and II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; accelerators would eventually reach {{nowrap|16&amp;nbsp;MHz}}.) The IIc Plus's accelerator was derived from a design licensed from Zip Technologies, a third-party maker of accelerators for the Apple II, though Apple used separate chips instead of combining the processor, cache, and supporting logic on a multi-chip module as did Zip. Like later models of the original Apple IIc, the IIc Plus included a memory expansion slot that would accept a daughter-card carrying up to a [[megabyte]] of RAM. The IIc Plus also featured a new keyboard layout that matched the Platinum IIe and II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. Unlike the IIe, IIc and II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;, the IIc Plus came only in one version (American) and was not officially sold anywhere outside the USA.

Many perceived the IIc Plus as Apple's attempt to compete with the [[Laser 128|Laser 128EX/2]], a popular third party Apple-compatible machine that also had an accelerated processor and a built-in 3.5-inch drive. There were few other rational explanations for Apple expending resources on the continued development of a new 8-bit Apple II model rather than furthering the 16-bit Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. However, with its 3.5-inch drive and speedy processor, it was an excellent, compact machine for running the [[AppleWorks]] integrated productivity package, especially with the 1&amp;nbsp;MB memory upgrade.

===Apple IIe Card===
{{Main|Apple IIe Card}}

Although not an extension of the Apple II line, in 1990 the '''[[Apple IIe Card]]''', an expansion card for the [[Macintosh LC|LC]] line of [[Macintosh]] computers, was released. Essentially a miniaturized Apple IIe computer on a card (using the Mega II chip from the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;), it allowed the Macintosh to run 8-bit Apple IIe software through [[hardware emulation]] (although video was emulated in software and was slower at times than a IIe). Many of the LC's built-in Macintosh peripherals could be &quot;borrowed&quot; by the card when in Apple II mode (i.e. extra RAM, 3.5-inch floppy, AppleTalk networking, hard disk). The IIe card could not, however, run software intended for the 16-bit Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;. The Macintosh LC with IIe Card was intended to replace the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; in schools and homes and was presumably the reason a new model Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; that was confirmed by insiders to be in development at one point was cancelled and never released.

===Final years===
Apple's [[Macintosh]] product line finally eclipsed the Apple II in the early 1990s. Even after the Macintosh's introduction, the Apple II had remained the company's primary revenue source for years. The computer was the first to attract a loyal user community and many outspoken Apple II fans were bitter that the company had invested its Apple II profits into the Macintosh rather than using them to further the Apple II series.

Apple continued to sell Apple II systems alongside the Macintosh until terminating the II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; in December, 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applematters.com/collections/apple-iigs/ |title=Apple IIGS // Collections |publisher=Applematters.com |date=May 23, 2005 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the IIe in November, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Weyhrich |url=http://apple2history.org/history/appy/ahb5.html |title=Apple II History Timeline |publisher=Apple2history.org |date=May 16, 2003 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising, marketing, and packaging==
[[File:Apple II advertisement Dec 1977 page 1.jpg|thumb|1977 ''Byte'' magazine advertisement for the original Apple&amp;nbsp;II]]
[[Mike Markkula]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Markkula1997&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/business/an-unknown-co-founder-leaves-after-20-years-of-glory-and-turmoil.html|title=An 'Unknown' Co-Founder Leaves After 20 Years of Glory and Turmoil|date=September 1, 1997|work=New York Times | first=John | last=Markoff | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a retired [[Intel]] salesman who provided early critical funding for Apple Computer, was keen on marketing. From 1977–1981, Apple used the [[Regis McKenna]] agency for its advertisements and marketing. In 1981, [[Chiat/Day|Chiat-Day]] acquired Regis McKenna's advertising operations and Apple used Chiat-Day. At Regis McKenna Advertising, the team assigned to launch the Apple II consisted of [[Rob Janoff]], art director, Chip Schafer, copywriter and Bill Kelley, account executive. Janoff came up with the Apple logo with a bite out of it. The design was originally an olive green with matching company logotype all in lower case. [[Steve Jobs]] insisted on promoting the color capability of the Apple II by putting rainbow stripes on the Apple logo. In its letterhead and business card implementation, the rounded &quot;a&quot; of the logotype echoed the &quot;bite&quot; in the logo. This logo was developed simultaneously with an advertisement and a brochure; the latter being produced for distribution initially at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. Ever since the original Apple II, Apple has paid high attention to its quality of packaging, partly because of [[Steve Jobs]]' personal preferences and opinions on packaging and final product appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Moritz|Moritz, Michael]]. ''The Little Kingdom''. New York, William Morrow and Company, Inc, 1984: pg. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; All of Apple's packaging for the Apple II series looked similar, featuring lots of clean white space and showing the Apple rainbow logo prominently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/appleIIgs-wozedition/complete-system/index.html A gallery of Apple IIGS packaging] from DigiBarn&lt;/ref&gt; For several years up until the late 1980s, Apple used the [[Apple typography#Motter Tektura|Motter Tekkura]] font for packaging, until changing to the [[Typography and logography of Apple Computer#Apple Garamond|Apple Garamond]] font.

Apple ran the first advertisement for the Apple II in the July 1977 edition of ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' – a two-page spread ad titled &quot;Introducing the Apple II&quot; and followed by a third page that was an order form. The first brochure, was entitled &quot;Simplicity&quot; and the copy in both the ad and brochure pioneered &quot;demystifying&quot; language intended to make the new idea of a home computer more &quot;personal.&quot; The Apple II introduction ad was later run in the September 1977 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.pyproject=Macintosh&amp;story=1984.txt&amp;topic=Marketing&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Apple IIc, Apple wanted an advertisement to demonstrate the power of the machine despite its small size; they ran a memorable television commercial featuring a high-rise office building in which they claimed with words and images that the IIc had all the power necessary to run a large building, suggesting that it had more than enough power for the home user. (This ad, along with the ''1984'' Macintosh ad, was featured in a Marketing telecourse run on PBS.&lt;!-- Marketing is the name and the subject of the telecourse. --&gt;)

Apple later aired eight television commercials for the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;, emphasizing its benefits to education and students, along with some print ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/movies9.html|title=Apple //gs Commercials Quicktime Movies @ The Apple Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of 1982, art director Brent Thomas and Steve Hayden came up with the idea of doing an [[advertising campaign]] based on the timely tagline &quot;Why 1984 will not be like 1984&quot;. Chiat-Day shopped it around to a number of clients, including Apple, where it was proposed to be used for a print ad in [[the Wall Street Journal]] promoting the Apple II. However, Apple did not go for it, and the idea was filed away until the spring of 1983, when they met with the Macintosh marketing team to start working on the launch, which was scheduled for January 1984. The idea eventually became the famous ''[[1984 (advertisement)|1984]]'' commercial which aired during the third quarter at [[Super Bowl XVIII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=1984.txt&amp;topic=Marketing&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date|title=Folklore.org: Macintosh Stories: 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clones==
[[Image:Taiwanese Apple II clone Cosmo.jpg|thumb|The Jiama (嘉馬) SPS-109, a [[Republic of China|Taiwanese]] clone of the Apple II, looks almost identical to the Apple II and II+, including an identical [[computer case|case]], color and [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] layout. The only noticeable physical difference is the label above the keyboard.]]

The Apple II was frequently cloned, both in the United States and abroad – similar cloning of the IBM PC later occurred. According to some sources (see below), more than 190 different models of [[List of Apple II clones|Apple II clones]] were manufactured. Many of these had &quot;fruit&quot; names (for example, &quot;Pineapple&quot;and &quot;Pearcom&quot;) to indicate to the initiated that they were Apple II clones. Apple successfully forced the &quot;Pineapple&quot; to change its name to &quot;Pinecom.&quot; Well known in the [[Soviet Bloc]] were the [[Agat computer|Agat]], an oversized Russian Apple II clone with a [[Cyrillic]] character set, and [[Bulgaria]]n [[Pravetz series 8]], a close Apple II replica with Cyrillic support.

Basis, a German company, created the Basis 108,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=92 |title=The Museum |publisher=Old-Computers.Com |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a clone for the Apple II that included both a 6502 processor and the Zilog Z80, allowing it to run the [[CP/M]] operating system as well as most Apple II software. This machine was unusual in that it was housed in a heavy cast aluminum chassis. The Basis 108 was equipped with built-in [[Centronics]] (parallel) and RS232c (serial) ports, as well as the standard six Apple II compatible slots. Unlike the Apple II it came with a detached full-stroke keyboard (AZERTY/QWERTY) of 100 keys plus 15 functions keys and separate numeric and editing keypads.

Another European Apple II Clone was the [[Pearcom]] Pear II, which was quite a bit larger as the original as it sported not eight but fourteen expansion slots. It also had a numerical keypad. Pearcom initially used a pear shaped rainbow logo, but stopped using the logo after Apple threatened to sue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apple2history.org/wp-content/gallery/ads-hardware-1982/pear2.jpg Pear II advert]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] (at the time part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) company named [[IRIS Computers]] (sub company of biggest electric company in Bosnia and [[Herzegovina]] and Yugoslavia ENERGOINVEST) has produced Apple II clones since the early 1980s. Their official brand name was IRIS 8. They were very expensive and hard to obtain and were produced primarily for usage in early computerized digital telephone systems and for education. Their usage in offices of the state companies, R&amp;D labs and in the Yugoslav army was also reported. IRIS 8 had looks of early IBM PCs – separate central unit with cooling system and two 5.25-inch disks, monitor and keyboard. Compatibility with original Apple II was complete. Elite high schools in Yugoslavia and especially Bosnia and Herzegovina were equipped with clusters of 8, 16 or 32 IRIS 8 computers connected in local network administrated by IRIS 16 PC clone. The number of IRIS 8s produced could be as many as a couple of tens of thousands{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

An Australian-produced clone of the Apple II was the [[Medfly computer|Medfly]], named after the [[Mediterranean fruit fly]] that attacks apples. The Medfly computer featured a faster processor, more memory, detached keyboard, lower and upper case characters and a built-in disk controller.

Unitron, a Brazilian company, produced another clone, named ApII. Unitron used a copy of the Apple's ROM translated to Portuguese. The operating system was Apple's DOS 3.3 translated to Portuguese. During this period, it was illegal to import microcomputers in Brazil, and buying those (illegal) clones was one of the only ways to have a microcomputer. (Another approach was to purchase a legitimate Apple II, disassemble it into parts (i.e. keyboard, power supply, motherboard, case), which were legal to import into Brazil, and reassemble them in country.) Unitron stopped manufacturing the ApII a few years after the introduction of IBM PC clones in Brazil.

The Ace clones from [[Franklin Computer Corporation]] are the best known and had the most lasting impact, as Franklin copied Apple's ROMs and software and freely admitted to doing so. Franklin's argument: a computer's ROM was simply a pattern of switches locked into a fixed position, and one cannot copyright a pattern of switches. Apple fought Franklin in court for about five years to get its clones off the market, and was ultimately successful when a court ruled that software stored in ROM was in fact copyrightable in the U.S. (See [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp.]]) Franklin later released non-infringing but less-compatible clones; these could run ProDOS and AppleWorks and had an Applesoft-like BASIC, but compatibility with other software was hit-or-miss.

Apple also challenged [[VTech]]'s [[Laser 128]], an enhanced clone of the Apple IIc first released in 1984, in court. This suit proved less fruitful for Apple, because VTech had [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the Monitor ROM rather than copying it and had licensed Applesoft BASIC from its creator, [[Microsoft]]. Apple had neglected to obtain exclusive rights to the Applesoft dialect of BASIC from Microsoft; VTech was the first cloner to license it. The Laser 128 proved popular and remained on the market for many years, both in its original form and in accelerated versions that ran faster than {{nowrap|1&amp;nbsp;MHz}}. Although it was not 100% compatible with the Apple II, it was close, and its popularity ensured that most major developers tested their software on a Laser as well as on genuine Apple machines. Because it was frequently sold via mail order and mass-market retailers such as [[Sears]], the Laser 128 may have cut into the sales of low-cost competitors such as [[Commodore Business Machines]] as much as it did Apple's.

While the first Apple II clones were generally exact copies of their Apple counterparts that competed mainly on price, many clones had extra capabilities too. A Franklin model, the Ace 1000, sported a numeric keypad and lower-case long before these features were added to the Apple II line. The Laser 128 series is sometimes credited with spurring Apple to release the Apple IIc Plus; the built-in 3½-inch drive and accelerated processor were features Laser had pioneered. The Laser 128 also had a IIe-style expansion slot on the side that could be used to add peripheral cards.

[[Böwe Bell &amp; Howell|Bell &amp; Howell]], an audiovisual equipment manufacturer whose products (particularly film projectors) were ubiquitous in American schools, offered what appeared at first glance to be an Apple II Plus clone in a distinctive black plastic case. However, these were in fact real Apple II Plus units manufactured by Apple for B&amp;H for a brief period of time. Many schools had a few of these Black Apple or [[Apple II Plus#Bell &amp; Howell|Black &quot;Darth Vader&quot; Apples]] in their labs.

[[ITT Corporation|ITT]] made the ITT 2020, a licensed Apple ][ Plus clone, in the UK. It has the same shape as the Apple ][ but is matte silver (it was sometimes known as the &quot;silver Apple&quot;) and is not an exact copy functionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vintagemacworld.com/itt2020.html ITT 2020 (Europlus clone)]&lt;/ref&gt; The ITT2020 produced a [[PAL]] video signal for the European market, where the domestic US market used [[NTSC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple-history.com/?page=gallery&amp;model=aII&amp;sort=family&amp;performa=off&amp;order=ASC Apple-history.com - comment from a designer of the 2020]&lt;/ref&gt; Software using the BIOS worked correctly on both the Apple and ITT, but software written to access the Apple's display hardware directly, bypassing the BIOS, displayed with vertical stripes on the ITT 2020. The Apple itself was later introduced in the UK, and both the Apple ][ and ITT 2020 were sold for a time, the ITT at a lower price.

Syscom 2 Inc (from Carson City, NV) created the Syscom 2 Apple ][+ clone. The case looked nearly identical. They had 48&amp;nbsp;k RAM and the normal expansion capabilities. These clones also supported lower case characters, toggled with a ^O keystroke.

An unknown company produced a clone called the RX-8800. One new feature it had was a numeric keypad.

Although not technically a clone, [[Quadram]] produced an add-in [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] card, called the Quadlink, that provided hardware emulation of an Apple II+ for the [[IBM PC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classiccmp.org/pipermail/cctech/2005-January/037465.html|title=Quadlink by Quadram – put an Apple II in you PC|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The card had its own 6502 CPU and dedicated 80&amp;nbsp;K RAM (64&amp;nbsp;K for applications, plus 16&amp;nbsp;K to hold a reverse-engineered Apple ROM image, loaded at boot-time), and installed &quot;between&quot; the PC and its floppy drive(s), color display, and speaker, in a pass-through configuration. This allowed the PC to operate in a [[dual-boot]] fashion: when booted through the Quadlink, the PC could run the majority of II software, and read and write Apple-formatted floppies through the standard PC floppy drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textfiles.com/digitize/items/1984-quadram-quips/.m/1984-quadram-quips-03.jpg|title=Quadram Quips (sales flyer)|publisher=[[Quadram]]|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it had a dedicated processor, rather than any form of software emulation, this system ran at nearly the same speed as an equivalent Apple machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n12/53_The_new_blue_Apple_Quadl.php|title=The new blue Apple; Quadlink makes your IBM think it's an Apple|publisher=[[Creative Computing]]|date=December 1983|last=Arrants|first=Stephen|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wS8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=quadram+quadlink#v=onepage&amp;q=quadram%20quadlink&amp;f=false|title=Review: Quadlink|publisher=[[Infoworld]]|year=1983|last=Lombardi|
first=John V|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another company, Diamond Computer Systems, produced a similar card called the Trackstar, that had both a 6502 &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; a Z80, allowing use of software for both Apple DOS and Apple CP/M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v11n11/67_Build_a_better_computer_.php|title=Build a better computer; a look at some new, interesting, and affordable additions for your IBM PC|publisher=[[Creative Computing]]|last=Lockwood|first=Russ|
date=November 1985|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trackstar also had a connector allowing use of an actual Apple floppy drive, which enhanced its compatibility with software that took advantage of Apple hardware for copy-protection.

Because the Apple II used so many unique concepts, many of them patented as well as copyrighted, Apple Computer was able to work with the U.S. Customs service to stop the import of many of the clones into the United States.

Most of the clone manufacturers chose to stop production on their own once the IBM PC became popular because it was possible to make legitimate clones of the PC which wouldn't violate any of IBM's patents or copyrights.

==General==
===Data storage===
Originally the Apple II used [[audio cassette]] tapes for program and data storage. A dedicated tape recorder along the lines of the [[Commodore Datasette]] was never produced; Apple recommended using the [[Panasonic Corporation|Panasonic]] RQ309 in some of its early printed documentation. The uses of common consumer cassette recorders and a standard video monitor or television set (with a third party R-F modulator) made the total cost of owning an Apple II less expensive and helped contribute to the Apple II's success.

Even after disk drives made the cassette input and output ports obsolete they were still used by enthusiasts as simple one-bit audio input-output ports. Ham radio operators used the cassette input to receive slow scan TV (single frame images). A commercial speech recognition Blackjack program was available, after some user-specific voice training it would recognize simple commands (Hit, stand). Bob Bishop's &quot;Color Kaleidoscope&quot; was a simple program which monitored the cassette input port and based on zero-crossings created color patterns on the screen, a predecessor to current audio visualzation plug-ins for media players. Color Kaleidoscope was especially popular on projection TV sets in dance halls.

Apple and many third-party developers made software available on tape at first, but after the Disk II became available in 1978, tape-based Apple II software essentially disappeared from the market. The initial price of the Disk II drive and controller was $595 USD, although a $100 off coupon was available through the Apple newsletter &quot;Contact&quot;. The controller could handle two drives and a second drive (without controller) retailed for $495.

The Disk II single-sided floppy drive used 5.25-inch [[floppy disk]]s; double-sided disks could be used, one side at a time, by turning them over and notching a hole for the write protect sensor. The first [[disk operating system]]s for the Apple II were [[Apple DOS|DOS 3.1]] and DOS 3.2, which stored 113.75&amp;nbsp;kB on each disk, organized into 35 tracks of 13 256-byte sectors each. After about two years, DOS 3.3 was introduced, storing 140&amp;nbsp;kB thanks to a minor firmware change on the disk controller that allowed it to store 16 sectors per track. (This upgrade was user-installable as two PROMs on older controllers.) After the release of DOS 3.3, the user community discontinued use of DOS 3.2 except for running legacy software. Programs that required DOS 3.2 were fairly rare; however, as DOS 3.3 was not a major architectural change aside from the number of sectors per track, a program called MUFFIN was provided with DOS 3.3 to allow users to copy files from DOS 3.2 disks to DOS 3.3 disks. It was possible for software developers to create a DOS 3.2 disk which would also boot on a system with DOS 3.3 firmware.

Later, double-sided drives, with heads to read both sides of the disk, became available from third-party companies. (Apple only produced double-sided 5.25&quot; disks for the Lisa 1 computer).

On a DOS 3.x disk, tracks 0, 1, and most of track 2 were reserved to store the operating system. (It was possible, with a special utility, to reclaim most of this space for data if a disk did not need to be bootable.) A short ROM program on the disk controller had the ability to seek to track zero – which it did without regard for the read/write head's current position, resulting in the characteristic &quot;chattering&quot; sound of a Disk II boot, which was the read/write head hitting the rubber stop block at the end of the rail – and read and execute code from sector 0. The code contained in there would then pull in the rest of the operating system. DOS stored the disk's directory on track 17, smack in the middle of the 35-track disks, in order to reduce the average [[seek time]] to the frequently-used directory track. The directory was fixed in size and could hold a maximum of 105 files. Subdirectories were not supported.

Most game publishers did not include DOS on their floppy disks, since they needed the memory it occupied more than its capabilities; instead, they often wrote their own boot loaders and read-only file systems. This also served to discourage &quot;crackers&quot; from snooping around in the game's copy-protection code, since the data on the disk was not in files that could be accessed easily. In addition, software companies would have had to pay Apple licensing fees to include DOS on their disks.

Some third-party manufacturers produced floppy drives that could write 40 tracks to most 5.25-inch disks, yielding 160&amp;nbsp;kB of storage per disk, but the format did not catch on widely, and no known commercial software was published on 40-track media. Most drives, even Disk IIs, could write 36 tracks; a two byte modification to DOS to format the extra track was common.

The Apple Disk II stored 140&amp;nbsp;kB on single-sided, &quot;single-density&quot; floppy disks, but it was very common for Apple II users to extend the capacity of a single-sided floppy disk to 280&amp;nbsp;kB by cutting out a second write-protect notch on the side of the disk using a &quot;disk notcher&quot; or hole puncher and inserting the disk flipped over. Double-sided disks, with notches on both sides, were available at a higher price, but in practice the magnetic coating on the reverse of nominally single-sided disks was usually of good enough quality to be used (both sides were coated in the same way to prevent warping, although only one side was certified for use). Early on, diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read/write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster, and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day. In practice, however, this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for no extra cost, and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well.

Later, Apple IIs were able to use 3.5-inch disks with a total capacity of 800&amp;nbsp;kB and hard disks. DOS 3.3 did not support these drives natively; third-party software was required, and disks larger than about 400&amp;nbsp;kB had to be split up into multiple &quot;virtual disk volumes.&quot;

DOS 3.3 was succeeded by [[Apple ProDOS|ProDOS]], a 1983 descendent of the Apple ///'s SOS. It added the capabilities for subdirectories and larger storage capacities. 

ProDOS became the Apple II operating system of choice for users with these larger disks thanks to its native support of volumes up to 32&amp;nbsp;MB in size and the fact that AppleWorks and other newer programs required it.

===Renditions of the &quot;II&quot; name===
The &quot;II&quot; portion of the Apple II name was rendered in a variety of creative ways using stylized characters which resembled punctuation symbols on the front lids of the computers, and most printed material followed this lead. The II and II+ were labeled &lt;nowiki&gt;][ and ][ plus&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; and II&lt;small&gt;c&lt;/small&gt; Plus were rendered in [[small caps]]. The [[Apple III]], IIc, and IIe models used slashes: ///, //c and //e. There have been some errors in the Apple II's name due to the numerous variations and forms on the &quot;II&quot;.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}

===Legacy===
Today, [[Apple II emulators|emulators]] for various Apple II models are available to run Apple II software on [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], homebrew enabled [[Nintendo DS]] and other operating systems. Numerous [[disk image]]s of Apple II software are available free over the Internet for use with these emulators. [[AppleWin]] and [[Multi Emulator Super System|MESS]] are among the best emulators compatible with most Apple II images. The MESS emulator supports recording and playing back of Apple II emulation sessions. The [http://www.homeactionreplay.org/search.php?tourney=36 Home Action Replay Page] (aka HARP) allows Apple II users to archive their favorite play sessions of the Apple II system and its games. However, many emulators cannot run software on copy-protected media, or can run only software employing fairly simple protection schemes, unless it is &quot;[[software cracking|cracked]]&quot; (copy restrictions removed). Breaking protection on software was widely popular in the Apple II's heyday; even Apple itself apparently engaged in the practice&lt;ref&gt;[http://apple2history.org/2010/11/18/even-apple-used-pirate-tools/ Even Apple Used Pirate Tools]. Apple2history.org (2010-11-18). Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial cracking software such as the popular [[Copy II+]] program were sold in stores with the purpose of creating legitimate back-ups of protected software. Although creating back-ups was legitimate under copyright law of the time, the use of such software today is of questionable legality in the U.S. (see [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]]). For those who prefer to obtain their old software legally, the Lost Classics Project has the goal of convincing copyright holders of classic Apple II software to officially allow unrestricted free distribution of their software and has &quot;freed&quot; a number of programs.

In addition, an active [[retrocomputing]] community of vintage Apple II collectors and users, continue to restore, maintain and develop hardware and software for daily use of these original computers. Numerous websites and support groups exist for these enthusiasts who maintain and use their machines. There is still a small annual convention, KansasFest, dedicated to the platform.

===Industry impact===
The Apple II series of computers had an enormous impact on the technology industry and on everyday life. The Apple II was the first personal computer many people ever saw. Its price was within the reach of many middle-class families, and a partnership with [[MECC]] helped make the Apple II popular in schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;lussenhop20110119&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lussenhop|first=Jessica|title=Oregon Trail: How three Minnesotans forged its path|url=http://www.citypages.com/content/printVersion/1740595/|accessdate=January 20, 2011|newspaper=City Pages|date=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1980 Apple had already sold over 100,000 Apple IIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Sy8vejqbcocC&amp;pg=RA1-PA19&amp;lpg=RA1-PA19&amp;dq=apple+IIe+educational+sales#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Essentials of Strategic Management By Charles Hill, Gareth Jones|isbn=9780547194325|author1=Hill|first1=Charles|last2=Jones|first2=Gareth|date=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity bootstrapped the [[Personal computer game|computer game]] and [[educational software]] markets and began the boom in the [[word processor]] and [[computer printer]] markets. The first microcomputer program for business was [[VisiCalc]], the earliest [[spreadsheet]], and it ran first on the Apple II. Many businesses bought Apple IIs just to run VisiCalc. Apple's success in the home market inspired competitive [[home computer]]s such as the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] (1980) and [[Commodore 64]] (1982, with estimated sales between 17 and 25 million units). Through their significantly lower price point, these models introduced the computer to several tens of millions more home users.

The success of the Apple II in business spurred [[IBM]] to create the [[IBM PC]], which was then purchased by middle managers in all lines of business to run spreadsheet and word processing software, at first ported from Apple II versions; later, whole new application software dynasties would be founded on the PC. The popularity of these PCs and their [[IBM PC compatible|clones]] then transformed business again with [[local area network|LAN]] applications such as e-mail and later Internet applications such as [[Usenet]] and the [[World Wide Web|WWW]].

The first 1000 or so Apple IIs shipped with a 68 page mimeoed &quot;Apple II Mini Manual&quot; bound with brass paper fastners. This was the basis for the ''Apple II Reference Manual'' (a/k/a Red book) which was published in January 1978. All existing customers who sent in their warranty cards were sent free copies of the Red Book.

The Apple II Reference Manual contained the complete schematic of the entire computer's circuitry and a complete source listing of the &quot;Monitor&quot; ROM firmware that served as the machine's [[BIOS]].
A revised spiral bound guide released several years later with updated information had to be purchased separately, and in the case of the Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;, the full technical documentation ran to several volumes).
The Apple II's slots, allowing any peripheral card to take control of the bus and directly access memory, enabled an independent industry of card manufacturers who together created a flood of hardware products that let users build systems that were far more powerful and useful (at a lower cost) than any competing system, most of which were not nearly as expandable and were universally proprietary. The first peripheral card was a blank prototyping card intended for electronics enthusiasts who wanted to design their own peripherals for the Apple II.

Specialty peripherals kept the Apple II in use in industry and education environments for many years after Apple Computer stopped supporting the Apple II. Well into the 1990s every cleanroom (the super-clean facility where spacecraft are prepared for flight) at the Kennedy Space Center used an Apple II to monitor the environment and air quality. Most planetariums used Apple IIs to control their projectors and other equipment.

Even the game port was unusually powerful and could be used for digital and analog input and output. The early manuals included instructions for how to build a circuit with only four commonly available components (one transistor and three resistors) and a software routine to drive a common ASR-33 teletype machine. One hacker ([[Don Lancaster]]) used the game I/O to drive a [[LaserWriter]] printer.

It is the first model in a [[Apple II series|series of computers]] which were produced until [[Apple IIe]] production ceased in November 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Weyhrich |url=http://apple2history.org/history/appy/ahb5.html |title=1990-1995 |publisher=Apple II History |date=May 16, 2003 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Apple II computers went on sale on June 5, 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/06/dayintech_0605 |title=June 5, 1977: From a Little Apple a Mighty Industry Grows |publisher=Wired |first=Tony |last=Long |date=June 5, 2007|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[MOS Technology]] [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] microprocessor running at {{nowrap|1 [[Hertz|MHz]]}}, {{nowrap|4 kB}} of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], an [[compact audio cassette#Data recording|audio cassette]] interface for loading programs and storing data, and the [[Integer BASIC]] programming language built into the [[read-only memory|ROMs]]. The video controller displayed 24 lines by 40 columns of monochrome, upper-case-only (the original character set matches ASCII characters 0x20 to 0x5F) text on the screen, with [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] [[composite video]] output suitable for display on a TV monitor, or on a regular TV set by way of a separate [[RF modulator]]. The original retail price of the computer was {{nowrap|1298 USD}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster| first=Winnie|authorlink=Winnie Forster|title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds &amp; home computers 1972 – 2005|year=2005|publisher=GAMEPLAN|isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with {{nowrap|4 kB}} of RAM) and {{nowrap|2638 USD}} (with the maximum {{nowrap|48 kB}} of RAM). To reflect the computer's [[Apple II graphics|color graphics]] capability, the Apple logo on the casing was represented using rainbow stripes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4-The Apple II, cont. |url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04.html|author=Steven Weyhrich|publisher=Apple II History |date=April 21, 2002|accessdate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998. The earliest Apple II's were assembled in [[Silicon Valley]], and later in Texas;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frank|last=Rose|title=West of Eden |publisher=Arrow Books|year=1989|page=3|isbn=0-09-976200-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[printed circuit board]]s were manufactured in Ireland and [[Singapore]].

An external 5¼-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the [[Disk II]], attached via a controller card that plugged into one of the computer's [[expansion slots]] (usually slot 6), was used for data storage and retrieval to replace cassettes. The Disk II interface, created by [[Steve Wozniak]], was regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=5-The Disk II|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html|publisher=Apple II History | author=Steven Weyhrich|date=December 28, 2001|accessdate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freiberger, Paul, and Michael Swaine. &quot;Fire In The Valley, Part Two (Book Excerpt)&quot;, A+ Magazine, January 1985: 45.&lt;/ref&gt; While other controllers had dozens of chips for synchronizing data I/O with disk rotation, seeking the head to the appropriate track, and encoding the data into magnetic pulses, Wozniak's controller card had few chips; instead, the [[Apple DOS]] used software to perform these functions. The [[Group Code Recording]] used by the controller was simpler and easier to implement in software than the more common [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]]. In the end, the low chip count of the controller helped make Apple's Disk II the first affordable floppy drive for personal computers. As a side effect, Wozniak's scheme made it easy for [[proprietary software]] developers to [[copy protection|copy-protect]] the media on which their software shipped by changing the low-level sector format or stepping the drive's head between the tracks; inevitably, other companies eventually sold software to foil this protection. Another Wozniak optimization allowed him to omit Shugart's Track-0 sensor. When the Operating System wants to go to track 0, the controller simply moves 40 times toward the next-lower-numbered track, relying on the mechanical stop to prevent it going any further down than track 0. This process, called &quot;recalibration&quot;, made a loud buzzing (rapid mechanical chattering) sound that often frightened Apple novices.

The approach taken in the Disk II controller was typical of Wozniak's design sensibility. The Apple II used several engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs. For example, taking advantage of the way that 6502 instructions only access memory every other clock cycle, the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise unused cycles avoided memory contention issues and also eliminated the need for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips. Rather than use a complex analog-to-digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period was proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.

The text and graphics screens had a complex arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which was reputedly due to Wozniak's realization that doing it that way would save a chip; it was less expensive to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline than to include the extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color was determined by pixel position and could thus be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for sub-pixel [[font]] rendering since orange and blue pixels appeared half a pixel-width further to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |title=The origins of sub-pixel font rendering |publisher=Gibson Research Corporation |last=Gibson |first=Steve|accessdate=August 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Color on the Apple II series took advantage of a quirk of the [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC television signal specification was black-and-white. Color was tacked on later by adding a 3.58-MHz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by B&amp;W TV sets. Color is encoded based on the ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'' of this signal in relation to a reference ''[[color burst]]'' signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into ''[[pixel]]s'' on the computer screen.

The Apple II display provided two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal was turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it could display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Later, blue and orange became available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the color-burst signal. The high-resolution display offered more colors simply by compressing more, narrower pixels into each subcarrier cycle. The coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode worked differently, as it could output a short burst of high-frequency signal per pixel to offer more color options.

The epitome of the Apple II design philosophy was the Apple II sound circuitry. Rather than having a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II had a toggle circuit that could only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two, three and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) were generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. Not for nearly a decade would an Apple II be released with a dedicated sound chip (though with six expansion slots, users could add sound functionality via a soundcard like the [[Mockingboard]]). Similar techniques were used for cassette storage: the cassette output worked the same as the speaker, and the input was a simple [[Zero crossing threshold detector|zero-crossing detector]] that served as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM were used to encode and decode data in [[frequency-shift keying]] for the cassette.

Wozniak's open design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including [[Apple II peripheral cards]] such as [[Apple II serial cards|Serial controllers]], display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, and networking components. There were plug-in [[expansion card]]s – such as the ''Z80-card''&lt;ref name=z80&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[InfoWorld]]|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group|date=February 6, 1984| issue=Vol. 6, Num. 6|quote=Several manufacturers, however, make Z80 coprocessor boards that plug into the Apple II.|page=64|title=Review: Premium Softcard IIe|last=Petersen|first=Marty}}&lt;/ref&gt; – that permitted the Apple to use the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and run a multitude of programs developed under the [[CP/M]] operating system,&lt;ref name=&quot;z80&quot;/&gt; including the [[dBase|dBase II]] database and the [[WordStar]] word processor. There was also a third-party [[Motorola 6809|6809]] card that would allow [[OS-9]] Level One to be run. The [[Mockingboard]] sound card greatly improved audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. Eventually, [[Apple II accelerators|Apple II accelerator cards]] were created to double or quadruple the computer's speed.

'''Power Source'''

Wozniak, whose passion was the circuitry, didn't concern himself with the issue of heat. But bringing into a PC the power necessary to keep all those circuits functioning can make for a lot of heat, and that can require a fan, a low-tech contraption in itself, to disperse said heat. Steve Jobs thought fans an inelegant solution, and looked for someone who could come up with a better one. 

Rod Holt is credited (for example in the [[Walter Isaacson]] biography of Jobs) with the solution. Holt created a power supply system like that used for oscilloscopes. It turned power on and off thousands of times a second. This required far less actual storage of power, and far less in terms of the generation of unwanted heat. 

Isaacson quotes Wozniak saying that this was not something he could have done.  &quot;I only knew vaguely what a switching power supply was.&quot;

'''Apple Records''' is a [[record label]] founded by [[The Beatles]] in 1968, as a division of [[Apple Corps|Apple Corps Ltd]]. It was initially intended as a creative outlet for the Beatles, both as a group and individually, plus a selection of other artists including [[Mary Hopkin]], [[James Taylor]], [[Badfinger]], and [[Billy Preston]]. In practice, by the mid-1970s, the roster had become dominated with releases by the former Beatles as solo artists. 
[[Allen Klein]] ran the label in 1969. It was then run by [[Neil Aspinall]] on behalf of the four Beatles and their heirs. He retired in 2007 and was replaced by Jeff Jones.

==History==
===Early years: 1967–1969===
Apple Corps was already conceived by [[Brian Epstein]] and The Beatles by 1967 when the Beatles had released their [[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour film]] under their new [[Apple Films]] division. Apple Records was officially founded in 1968 as another sub-division of The Beatles' own [[Apple Corps]], which was established as a small group of companies (Apple Retail, Apple Publishing, Apple Electronics and so on). At this time, The Beatles were contracted to [[Parlophone]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Capitol Records]] in the [[United States]]. In a new distribution deal, EMI and Capitol agreed to distribute Apple Records until 1975, while EMI retained ownership of The Beatles' recordings. Recordings issued on the Apple label carried Parlophone R-prefixed catalogue numbers. Apple Records owns the rights to all of The Beatles' videos and movie clips, and the rights to recordings of other artists signed to the label. The first catalogue number, Apple 1, was a one-off pressing of [[Frank Sinatra]] singing &quot;Maureen Is A Champ&quot; (with lyrics by [[Sammy Kahn]]) to the tune of [[The Lady Is a Tramp|Lady Is A Tramp]] for [[Ringo Starr]]'s then-wife Maureen.

Initially, Apple Records and Apple Publishing signed a number of acts whom The Beatles personally discovered or supported, and in most cases one or more of The Beatles would be involved in the recording sessions. Several notable artists were signed in the first year including [[James Taylor]], [[Mary Hopkin]], [[Billy Preston]], The [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] and The Iveys (who later became [[Badfinger]]).

===Klein era: 1970–1975===
In 1969, the Beatles were in need of financial and managerial direction and Lennon was introduced to [[Allen Klein]] through [[Mick Jagger]], as Klein was managing [[The Rolling Stones]] at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CynthiaJohnp323&quot;&gt;Cynthia Lennon “John” 2006 p323&lt;/ref&gt; Klein went on to manage Apple, by virtue of his three-to-one support from the Beatles, Paul McCartney the only group member opposed to his involvement.  (McCartney had suggested his then new father-in-law [[Lee Eastman]] for the job.)  &lt;!-- expand please: controversial guy--&gt;

After Klein took control of Apple, several sub-divisions, including Apple Electronics, were shut down, and some of Apple Records' artistic roster effectively dropped. Thereafter, new signings were not so numerous, and tended to arrive through the individual actions of The (ex-)Beatles, with the formal approval of the others. (e.g., Elephant's Memory were recruited through John Lennon, Ravi Shankar through George Harrison, etc.) Paul McCartney had little input into Apple Records' roster after 1970. Klein managed Apple Corp. until March 1973 when his contract expired.

===Beatles reissues: 1976–2006===
Original U.K. versions of all standard Beatles albums were released worldwide on CD in 1987 and 1988 on the Parlophone label with no Apple logo, even including albums originally released on Apple. Previously, ''Abbey Road'' had been issued on CD by the EMI-Odeon label in Japan in the early 1980s. Although this was a legitimate release, it was not authorised by the Beatles, the main EMI company or Apple Corps. As a result, very few were made. It was not until the ''[[1962–1966]]''/''[[1967–1970]]'' reissues, [[Live at the BBC (The Beatles album)|BBC sessions]] and [[The Beatles Anthology]] series that Apple labels started appearing on the CDs. Subsequent releases have been on the familiar Apple label or at least had the Apple logo, including copies of the 1987 and 1988 catalogue. It was after the ''Anthology'' project (spearheaded by [[Neil Aspinall]]) that the company resumed making significantly large profits again and began its revival.

===Revival: 2006 to present===
In 2006 the label was again newsworthy, as the long-running dispute between Apple Records' parent company and [[Apple Inc.]] went to the High Court (see [[Apple Corps v Apple Computer]]). In 2007, the company settled a dispute with [[EMI]] over royalties, and announced that long term chief executive [[Neil Aspinall]] had retired and been replaced by American music industry executive [[Jeff Jones (music industry executive)|Jeff Jones]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTJones&quot;&gt;Kozinn, Allan, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour Ends for Apple Corps Executive&quot;, ''[[New York Times]]'', 12 April 2007, ''passim''. ([http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/arts/music/12beat.html link])&lt;/ref&gt; These changes led to speculation that the Apple Records catalogue — and most importantly [[The Beatles discography]] — would soon appear on Apple Inc.'s [[iTunes]] [[online music store]],&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Jonny, &quot;EMI, Apple Corps deal good news for iTunes?&quot;, ''[[Macworld]]'', 12 April 2007 ([http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=17737&amp;pagtype=allchandate link])&lt;/ref&gt; and that a remastering and reissue program of The Beatles' CDs might be forthcoming (Jones having worked on reissues at Sony).&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTJones&quot;/&gt; On 1 July 2010, it was reported that [[Capitol Records]] was planning a re-release strategy for most of Apple's back catalogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Showbiz411&quot;&gt;Friedman, Roger, &quot;The Beatles’ Apple Records: Making a Comeback&quot;, 1 July 2010, ([http://www.showbiz411.com/2010/07/01/the-beatles-apple-records-making-a-comeback])&lt;/ref&gt; This would include re-releases of material by artists who worked at Apple including [[Badfinger]], [[James Taylor]], [[Billy Preston]] and [[Mary Hopkin]]. On November 16, 2010, Apple Inc. launched an extensive advertising campaign that announced the availability of The Beatles entire catalog on iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/11/16itunes.html The Beatles Now on iTunes] - Apple Inc. press release&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[Image:Apple Iveys.JPG|thumb|This example shows the German release of [[The Iveys]]' album ''[[Maybe Tomorrow (The Iveys album)|Maybe Tomorrow]]''.]]
Standard Apple album and single labels displayed a bright green [[Granny Smith]] [[apple]] on the A-side, while the flipside displayed the midsection of the apple cut in half. The bright green apple returned for Beatles [[Compact disc|CDs]] releases in the 1990s, following initial CD releases on [[Parlophone]]. However, on the U.S. issue of the Beatles' ''[[Let It Be]]'' album, the Granny Smith apple was red. The reason was that in the United States that album, being the soundtrack to the movie of the same name, was, for contractual reasons, being manufactured and distributed by United Artists Records and not Capitol Records, so the red apple was used to mark the difference. The red apple also appeared on the back cover, and on the 2009 remastered edition back cover. In the late 70s, Capitol's parent company EMI later purchased United Artists Records and Capitol gained the American rights to the ''Let It Be'' soundtrack album (along with the America rights to another, earlier, UA Beatles movie soundtrack LP, 1964's  ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]''). Aside from the red apple, there have been other examples where the apple has been changed, notably on [[George Harrison]]'s ''[[Extra Texture (Read All About It)]]'', where it is eaten away apple core (this was intended to be a joke because it was released at a time when Apple Records was beginning to fold).
And there were some more: in 1970 for [[George Harrison]]'s ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' triple album two records that have orange apples and one with an Apple Jam jar; in 1970 for ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'' and ''[[Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band]]'' black and white apple labels; in 1972 for [[Ringo Starr]]'s ''[[Back Off Boogaloo]]'' blue apples; in 1975 for [[Ringo Starr]]'s ''[[Blast From Your Past]]'' red apples. Also other type of apples were used: in 1971 for [[John Lennon]]'s ''[[Imagine (album)|Imagine]]'' and [[Yoko Ono]]'s ''[[Fly]]'', in 1973 for [[Yoko Ono]]'s ''[[Approximately Infinite Universe]]'' and the singles that were released from those three albums.

==Zapple Records==
'''Zapple Records''', an Apple Records subsidiary run by [[Barry Miles]], a friend and ultimately biographer of [[Paul McCartney]], was intended as an outlet for the release of [[spoken word]] and [[avant garde]] records. It was active from October 1968 until June 1969, and only two albums were released on the label, one by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] (''[[Unfinished Music No.2: Life With The Lions]]'') and one by [[George Harrison]] (''[[Electronic Sound]]''). An album of readings by [[Richard Brautigan]] was planned for release as Zapple 3, and [[acetate disc]] copies were cut, but, said Miles, &quot;The Zapple label was folded by Klein before the record could be released. The first two Zapple records did come out. We just didn't have [Brautigan's record] ready in time before Klein closed it down. None of the Beatles ever heard it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;&gt;[[Barry Miles]], as quoted by [[Richie Unterberger]] in the [http://www.richieunterberger.com/brautigan.html sleevenotes] to the eventual non-Apple release of ''Listening To Richard Brautigan''.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Zapple.png|thumb|right|The Zapple label of George Harrison's ''[[Electronic Sound]]'' LP (US issue)]] Brautigan's record was eventually released as ''Listening To Richard Brautigan'' on [[Harvest Records]], a subsidiary of Apple distributor EMI, in the US only.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot; /&gt; According to Miles, a spoken word album by [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], which had been recorded and edited, would have been Zapple 4, and a spoken word album by [[Michael McClure]] had also been recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot; /&gt;  A planned Zapple release of a UK appearance by comedian [[Lenny Bruce]] was never completed. An early 1969 press release also named Pablo Casals as an expected guest on the label.  As noted above, Zapple was shut down in June 1969 by Klein, apparently with the backing of [[John Lennon]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Archive Hour'', [[BBC Radio 4]], 12 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists who signed with Apple Records==
* [[Badfinger]] (originally known as The Iveys) - Signed to Apple after several demo tapes were brought in by [[Mal Evans]], after getting approval from McCartney, Harrison and Lennon. They had several top 10 hits in the UK and US, including the Paul McCartney song &quot;Come And Get It&quot;, and recorded five albums for Apple.
* [[Black Dyke Mills Band]] (as John Foster &amp; Sons Ltd. Black Dyke Mills Band) - A north of England brass band whom Paul McCartney employed for the one-off &quot;Thingummybob&quot;/&quot;[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]&quot; single. It was recorded by McCartney on location near Bradford, where the group were based.
* [[Brute Force (musician)|Brute Force]] (stage name of Stephen Friedland) - George Harrison attempted to have his song &quot;King of Fuh&quot; released as an Apple single. EMI refused to handle it due to its references to &quot;the Fuh king&quot;, but Apple manufactured a small number of copies in-house which were made available to the public. The song itself appears on the 2010 compilation, ''[[Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records]]''.
* [[Elastic Oz Band]] - A one-off single, &quot;God Save Us&quot;, was written and produced by John Lennon and Yoko Ono to raise money for a legal battle involving ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' magazine. The A-side of the single was sung by Bill Elliot, later of [[George Harrison]]'s [[Dark Horse Records]] signing [[Splinter (band)|Splinter]].
* [[Elephant's Memory]] - Recruited as backing band for John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and also released material separately.
* [[Chris Hodge]] - Discovered by Ringo Starr; they shared an interest in UFOs. Hodge only released two singles on Apple, the second not issued in the UK.
* [[Mary Hopkin]] - Discovered after appearing on a UK television talent show. Early recordings were produced by Paul McCartney, including the Lennon-McCartney original &quot;Goodbye&quot; and her hit recording of &quot;[[Those Were the Days (song)|Those Were the Days]]&quot;. She also released a Eurovision Song Contest entry on Apple (&quot;Knock Knock, Who's There&quot;) and two studio albums.
* [[Hot Chocolate (band)|Hot Chocolate]] (as Hot Chocolate Band) - Released one single, &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot;, which they recorded and had played to John Lennon, who liked it. Their post-Apple releases as Hot Chocolate were more commercially successful.
* [[Jackie Lomax]] - Liverpudlian singer known via his Brian Epstein connections, he recorded with Harrison, McCartney and Starr at various times. His first single &quot;Sour Milk Sea&quot; features all three and was written by Harrison.
* [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] - Associated with Yoko Ono, and were famous prior to their involvement with Apple. They released two albums for the label.
* [[Yoko Ono]] - Recorded extensively with John Lennon and released several singles and albums herself, with Lennon usually performing, and directing the band.
* [[David Peel (musician)|David Peel]] and the Lower East Side - Political folk singer brought to the label by John Lennon.
* [[Billy Preston]] - Brought in to work with the Beatles in January 1969 on their &quot;Get Back&quot; / &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions, and signed as a solo artist. George Harrison worked on some of Preston's recordings which include the hit single &quot;That's The Way God Planned It&quot;. Preston's recording of Harrison's &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; was released on Apple before Harrison's version. Preston issued two albums on Apple in 1969-70.
* [[Radha Krsna Temple|Radha Krishna Temple]], the London [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] temple - George Harrison brought them to the label and produced a single and album for them.
* [[Ravi Shankar]] (with [[Ali Akbar Khan]]) - A classical Indian musician. George Harrison brought him to the label.
* [[Ronnie Spector]] - Married to Phil Spector, who separately worked with the Beatles and solo Beatles around 1970. George Harrison and John Lennon appear on her only Apple single &quot;Try Some Buy Some&quot;, which was made with her husband, as an attempt to revive her recording career.
* [[The Sundown Playboys]] - A [[French language|French]]-language [[cajun]] band from [[Louisiana]]. A pre-existing single was brought to the label by Ringo Starr.
* [[John Tavener]] - A classical composer. His brother, a builder, worked on Ringo Starr's house, and Starr took interest in Tavener.
* [[James Taylor]] - Recorded with Paul McCartney, who appears on the Apple LP which launched his career.
* [[White Trash (band)|Trash]] (originally White Trash) - Brought to Apple by Tony Meehan, formerly of the Shadows. Their second single was a cover of &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; and charted on Apple in the UK.
* [[Doris Troy]] - An American soul artist since the early 1960s, who worked with George Harrison and Billy Preston while the latter was signed to Apple. She recorded one Apple album, and released a few spin-off singles.
* [[Lon and Derek Van Eaton]] - Brought in during 1970s by George Harrison, who worked on their Apple album.

Also released were the soundtracks to ''[[Come Together (film)|Come Together]]'' and ''[[El Topo]]'' (in the U.S.), the onetime [[Philles Records]] compilation ''[[Phil Spector's Christmas Album]]'' and the multi-artist ''[[The Concert for Bangla Desh]]''.  Cassette and 8-track tape versions of ''Bangla Desh'' were marketed by [[Columbia Records]], in a deal that permitted the inclusion of [[Bob Dylan]], a Columbia artist, on the album.

Artists who went on to have considerable success in the pop and rock world (though in some cases, for their post-Apple work) include [[Badfinger]] (originally known as The Iveys), [[James Taylor]], [[Mary Hopkin]], [[Hot Chocolate (band)|Hot Chocolate]], [[Yoko Ono]] and [[Billy Preston]].

Artists who were to appear on the label, but did not make it, include:
* [[Roger McGough|McGough]] and [[Mike McGear|McGear]], whose self-titled album was due to be released on Apple, but it was released on [[Parlophone]] Records, to which both were signed, as members of [[The Scaffold]];
* [[Grapefruit (band)|Grapefruit]], whose single &quot;Dear Delilah&quot; was issued on RCA Records with Apple Records publishing credit;
* [[Focal Point (60's Band)|Focal Point]], a Liverpool band who were going to be managed by Brian Epstein before he died, were signed to Apple after chasing Paul McCartney around Hyde Park. John Lennon and Brian Epstein signed them to Apple, and they were the first band signed.  Their single &quot;Sycamore Sid&quot; was issued on [[Deram Records]] with credit to Apple Publishing on the label.
*Fire ( a band with future Strawbs member Dave Lambert on guitar) released two singles in 1968,  Father's Name Was Dad, (produced by Tony Clarke) and Round The Gum Tree, on Decca with Apple publishing credits 
* [[Delaney and Bonnie]]'s ''[[Accept No Substitute]]'' album was originally meant to be released on Apple in 1969; it was originally commercially released on [[Elektra Records]] the same year.
* Mortimer were a folk-based three-piece, notable for a recording of the Beatles' &quot;Two Of Us&quot;. It was planned for release as an Apple single in 1969 (before the Beatles' version was issued) under the title &quot;On Our Way Home&quot;, but the release was cancelled.
* Slow Dog (Wheels) who were a Cambridge based rock band headed up by Scottish singer/guitarist Dave Kelly. They were the winners of the Apple Records sponsored national talent contest early 1969, organised by Apple A &amp; R head [[Peter Asher]] prior to his departure for the US. The winner of the talent contest was promised a record contract with Apple Records, but the band only recorded demo tracks, due to Asher's departure.  However, on the recommendation from Beatles' roadie [[Mal Evans]], Warner Brothers Records in London, headed up by Ian Ralfini, signed Slow Dog to a record contract, changing their name to Wheels.

The '''Town of Apple Valley''' is located in the [[Victor Valley]] of [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. It was incorporated on November 14, 1988, and is one of the twenty-two [[List of cities in California|incorporated municipalities]] in California that uses &quot;town&quot; in its name instead of &quot;city.&quot;  The town is east of and adjoining to the neighboring cities of [[Victorville, California|Victorville]] and [[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]], &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;37&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(60&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt; south of [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] and &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap&quot;&gt;46&amp;nbsp;miles&amp;nbsp;(74&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;/span&gt; north of [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] through the [[Cajon Pass]]. The population was 69,135 at the 2010 census.

Apple Valley is governed by a ''town council'', whose current mayor is Scott Nassif.  The Mayor changes each December. By policy, the highest vote getter in the most recent election is selected mayor by the five-member Council.&lt;!-- gotta do more research here. . .  it looks like San Berdoo County may have a different way of legally defining &quot;town&quot; than Los Angeles County.  From its website, it sure sounds like a city, though.  But of course, they say themselves it's a town. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.applevalley.org/index.aspx?page=308 | title = Town of Apple Valley - Town Council | accessdate = 2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple Valley was home to [[Roy Rogers]] and [[Dale Evans]], whose museum was first established in Apple Valley (in 1967) before the museum was relocated to Victorville in 1976.  Since 2003, the museum has been in [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]], [[Missouri]]. The move was made in hopes of reaching more fans;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Valley Daily Press.

Apple Valley is the final resting place for both Roy and Dale. There are reminders of the Rogers family everywhere including roads and highways. Roy and Dale created St. Hillary's Episcopal Church, founded a home for boys, and took in some 20-40 children and raised them as their own.

==Geography==
Apple Valley is located at {{Coord|34|31|N|117|13|W|type:city}} (34.5115, -117.2120).{{GR|1}}

Apple Valley is located at the southern edge of the [[Mojave Desert]].  It is bordered by the cities of [[Victorville, California|Victorville]] on the west and [[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]] on the southwest sides, with the village of [[Lucerne Valley, California|Lucerne Valley]] a distance to the east. These three incorporated towns, along with city of [[Adelanto, California|Adelanto]], are commonly known as the [[Victor Valley]]. The primary thoroughfare through Apple Valley is [[California State Route 18|State Route 18]], which is known locally as the &quot;Happy Trails Highway&quot;, named after the theme song of [[Roy Rogers]] and [[Dale Evans]].  Roy and Dale once resided on Outer Highway 18.  The commercial area is split currently between State Route 18 and Bear Valley Road (both roads are parallel until they intersect in the east outside of town). *The Mojave River that boarders the west side of Apple Valley, is one of the only two rivers in the world to flow magnetic north. The Nile located in North East Africa is the other.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|73.5|sqmi|km2}} of which {{convert|73.2|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|km2}}, or 0.45%, is water.

==History==
For centuries, Apple Valley was populated by [[Shoshonean]], [[Paiute]], [[Vanyume]], [[Chemehueve]] and the [[Serrano]] who were attracted to the water and vegetation around the Mojave River. The [[Mojave people|Mojave]] people came later and were the tribal group encountered in 1542 by  a detachment of Coronado's men. These were the first Spanish to come to the Mojave desert.

Pedro Fages came through the area in 1772, looking for deserters. Father Garces spent time in the area in 1776. He was on good terms with local tribes. He killed one of his mules to feed a group of starving Vanyumes. Garces established a trail across the Mojave to the Colorado River passing through the Apple Valley area.

The area was explored by various Spanish gold seekers in the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Jedediah Smith]] established the Old Spanish Trail through the southern Mojave and Cajon Pass. Smith was in the area in 1826 and again in 1827.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellsworh A Sylvester 1974, pg 125&quot;&gt;Apple Valley-Crossroads of the Desert by Ellsworh A Sylvester, San Bernardino County Museum Commemorative Edition, Allen=Greendale Publishers, Redlands, CA. 1974, pg 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th century, Apple Valley became a thoroughfare of people traveling to Southern California for various reasons. Ute horse thieves, led by Chief Walkara, brought through an estimated 100,000 horses from their raids on the Lugo Rancho and [[San Gabriel Mission]]. 

In 1848, members of the [[Mormon Battalion]], mustered out of the U.S. Army after constructing the first wagon road across the southwest to San Diego and up to Los Angeles, brought 135 mules and the first wagon through the Cajon Pass up through the Mojave River Valley on the way to the Salt Lake Valley. Battalion leader [[Jefferson Hunt]] and a crew of cowboys followed the trail with the first cattle drive from Southern California to hungry Mormons in Utah. Hunt led a Mormon group of settlers to the San Bernardino Valley in 1851.

In 1885, the railroad came northward through the Cajon Pass and established a train stop, calling it Victor(Victorville) on the Mojave River in the area then known as Mormon Crossing. John Brown helped build some of the first roads through Apple Valley opening up freight and stagecoach travel from the mining camps at Gold Mountain and Holcomb Valley to the railroad. In the 1860s, Mormon pioneer LaFayette Mecham built the wagon road, a short cut across the desert, now known as Stoddard Wells Road. Over the next few decades, Victorville boomed as the commercial center of the area with gold refineries, quarries, dance halls and saloons, while Apple Valley remained more pastoral with ranches and apple orchards.

The naming of Apple Valley is usually associated with John F. Appleton.  However, the name was finalized with development in the 1940's.  The Apple Valley name was officially recognized when a post office was established in 1949.&lt;ref name=gudde&gt;{{cite book|first=Erwin|last=Gudde| coauthors =William Bright |title=California Place Names|year=2004|edition=Fourth ed.|publisher=University of California Press|pages=15|isbn=0-520-24217-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One well known apple orchard was owned by [[Max Ihmsen]], publisher of the Los Angeles Examiner newspaper. In 1915, he developed {{convert|320|acre|km2}} of apples and pears. The fame of Apple Valley spread as Ihmsen fruit won many agricultural awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.applevalley.org/Index.aspx?page=587&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, Ihmsen's son-in-law, Cal Godshall, took over the business operations and made the ranch famous as the birthplace of California college rodeo with the first intercollegiate rodeo competition ever held in the United States.

Apple farming in the area started to decline about the time Ihmsen Ranch fruit production was at its prime. Water rates shot up with a switch to electric pumps. World War I took owners and workers away with the draft. During the Great Depression many families left the mostly agricultural area looking for work. Washington and British Columbia apple growers were able to cut prices because they shipped their produce by river transportation, whereas Apple Valley apples were transported by rail or by truck. The death knell was a series of outbreaks of a virulent fungus infections coupled with frost, heat and hail in 1944, 1945 and 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellsworh A Sylvester 1974, pg 125&quot;/&gt;

A small orchard was maintained on the grounds of the [[Apple Valley Inn]] until it closed in 1986. But the last commercially grown apples in Apple Valley had all but disappeared before the US Post Office officially recognized the name.

'''Apple Corps Ltd.''' (informally known as '''Apple''') is a multi-armed multimedia [[corporation]] founded in January 1968 by the members of [[The Beatles]] to replace their earlier company (Beatles Ltd.) and to form a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]].&lt;!-- The Apple name appeared as far back as Sgt. Pepper --&gt; Its name (pronounced &quot;apple core&quot;) is a [[pun]]. Its chief division is [[Apple Records]], which was launched in the same year. Other divisions included Apple Electronics, Apple Films, Apple Publishing, and Apple Retail, whose most notable venture was the ill-fated [[Apple Boutique]] in [[London]]. Apple's headquarters, in the late-1960s, was on 94 [[Baker Street]], after was at 3 [[Savile Row]] in London, known as the Apple Building, which was also home to the Apple Studio.

From 1970–2007, Apple's chief executive was former Beatles' road manager [[Neil Aspinall]], though he did not officially bear that title until [[Allen Klein]] had left the company. The current CEO is [[Jeff Jones (music industry executive)|Jeff Jones]]. In 2010, Apple Corps ranked #2 on the ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' magazine's list of the world's most innovative companies in the music industry, thanks to the release of ''[[The Beatles: Rock Band]]'' video game and the remastering of The Beatles' catalogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;MostInnovativeCompanies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/mic/2010/industry/most-innovative-music-companies |title=Most Innovative Companies|publisher=Mansueto Ventures LLC  |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Beatles' accountants had informed the group that they had two million pounds which they could either invest in a business venture or else lose to the [[Inland Revenue]], because corporate/business taxes were lower than their individual tax bills.{{sfn|Cross|2007|p=152}} According to [[Peter Brown (music industry)|Peter Brown]], personal assistant to Beatles' manager [[Brian Epstein]], activities to find tax shelters for the income that The Beatles generated began as early as 1963–64, when Dr Walter Strach &lt;ref&gt;http://www.beatlesbible.com/1965/02/23/filming-help/&lt;/ref&gt; was put in charge of such operations.{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=117}} First steps into that direction were the foundation of Beatles, Ltd. and in early 1967, Beatles and Co.{{sfn|Cross|2007|p=152}}

The Beatles' publicist, [[Derek Taylor]], remembered that [[Paul McCartney]] had the name for the new company when he was visited Taylor's company flat in London: &quot;We're starting a brand new form of business. So, what is the first thing that a child is taught when he begins to grow up? A is for Apple&quot;. McCartney then suggested the addition of Apple ''Core'', but they could not register the name, so they used &quot;Corps&quot; (having the same pronunciation).{{sfn|Cross|2007|p=199}} McCartney later revealed that he had been inspired by [[René Magritte|René Magritte's]] painting, ''Le Jeu de Mourre'', featuring an apple with the words &quot;Au revoir&quot; painted on it.{{sfn|Cross|2007|p=199}} Harriet Vyner’s 1999 book about the late lamented charismatic London art dealer [[Robert Fraser (art dealer)|Robert Fraser]], &quot;Groovy Bob&quot; contains this anecdote by [[Paul McCartney]] about the first time he laid eyes on the painting that would inspire the company logo in 1967:&lt;ref&gt;Groovy Bob: The Life and Times of Robert Fraser by Harriet Vyner, Faber, 317 pp, October 1999, ISBN 0 571 19627 6&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=In my garden at Cavendish Avenue, which was a 100-year-old house I’d bought, Robert was a frequent visitor. One day he got hold of a Magritte he thought I’d love. Being Robert, he would just get it and bring it. I was out in the garden with some friends. I think I was filming [[Mary Hopkin]] with a film crew, just getting her to sing live in the garden, with bees and flies buzzing around, high summer. We were in the long grass, very beautiful, very country-like. We were out in the garden and Robert didn’t want to interrupt, so when we went back in the big door from the garden to the living room, there on the table he’d just propped up this little Magritte. It was of a green apple. That became the basis of the Apple logo. Across the painting Magritte had written in that beautiful handwriting of his ‘Au revoir’. And Robert had split. I thought that was the coolest thing anyone’s ever done with me&quot;.|}}

===Formation===
On the founding of Apple [[John Lennon]] commented: &quot;Our accountant came up and said 'We got this amount of money. Do you want to give it to the government or do something with it?' So we decided to play businessmen for a bit because we've got to run our own affairs now. So we've got this thing called 'Apple' which is going to be records, films, and electronics – which all tie up&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LennonMcCartneyTonightShow&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1968.05ts.beatles.html |title=Lennon &amp; McCartney Interview, The Tonight Show|publisher=Beatles Interviews |date=14 May 1968 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stefan Granados wrote in ''Those Were the Days: An Unofficial History of the &quot;Beatles&quot; Apple Organization 1967–2001'', on the various processes that lead to the formation of Apple Corps:
{{quote|The first step towards creating this new business structure was to form a new partnership called Beatles and Co. in April 1967. To all intents and purposes, Beatles and Co. was an updated version on The Beatles' original partnership, Beatles Ltd. Under the new arrangement, however, each Beatle would own 5% of Beatles and Co. and a new corporation owned collectively by all four Beatles [which would soon be known as Apple] would be given control of the remaining 80% of Beatles and Co. With the exception of individual songwriting royalties, which would still be paid directly to the writer or writers of a particular song, all of the money earned by the Beatles as a group would go directly to Beatles and Co. and would thus be taxed at a far lower corporate tax rate&quot;.{{sfn|Granados|2002|p=6}}&lt;ref name=&quot;BeatleMoneyAppleCorps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlemoney.com/applefacts.htm |title=Apple Corps: General Statements|publisher=Beatle Money |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Now that a new business structure was found with a lower tax rate, Epstein mused what to do with it in order to justify it to the authorities, and originally thought of it mostly as a merchandising company, as according to Lennon's first wife, [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]]: &quot;The idea Brian came up with was a company called Apple. His idea was to plough their money into a chain of shops not unlike Woolworth's in concept: Apple boutiques, Apple posters, Apple records. Brian needed an outlet for his boundless energy&quot;.{{sfn|Lennon|1978|p=146}} Personal assistant to Epstein, [[Alistair Taylor]] remembered:&lt;ref&gt;Yesterday: The Beatles Remembered with Martin Robers , Pan Macmillan (1988), p. 108, ISBN 0-283-99621-8&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We set up an 'Executive Board' of Apple before Brian died, including Brian, the accountant, a solicitor, Neil Aspinall, myself, and then sat down to work out ways of spending the money. One big idea was to set up a chain of shops designed only to sell cards: birthday cards, Christmas cards, anniversary cards. When the boys heard about that they all condemned the scheme as the most boring yet. Sure that they could come up with much better brainwaves, they began to get involved themselves&quot;.{{sfn|Taylor|1988|p=108}}}} In the middle of setting up the new company, manager Epstein died unexpectedly in what seemed an accidental sleeping pills overdose on 27 August 1967, which pressed The Beatles to accelerate their plans to gain control of their own financial affairs. In addition to providing an umbrella to cover The Beatles' own financial and business affairs, Apple was intended to provide a means of financial support to anyone in the wider world struggling to get 'worthwhile' artistic projects off the ground. According to Granados, this idea probably first originated with Paul McCartney as the Beatle most engaged in London's local avant-garde scene, &quot;McCartney was among the best-known exponents of swinging London&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThoseWeretheDaysBookonline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070829121144/www.cherryred.co.uk/books/thoseweretheday_txt.php |title=Those Were the Days - The Beatles Apple Organization |first=Stefan |last=Granados |publisher=[[Cherry Red Records]] |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] was quoted as saying of the venture:&lt;ref&gt;Granados, M. Those Were the Days. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|We tried to form Apple with Clive Epstein, but he wouldn't have it... He didn't believe in us I suppose... He didn't think we could do it. He thought we were four wild men and we were going to spend all his money and make him broke. But that was the original idea of Apple - to form it with NEMS... We thought now Brian's gone let's really amalgamate and get this thing going, let's make records and get people on our label and things like that. So we formed Apple and they formed NEMS, which is exactly the same thing as we are doing. It was a family tie and we thought it would be a good idea to keep it in&quot;.|}}

McCartney at first had obviously intended to use Epstein's music publishing company [[NEMS Enterprises]] for these plans, but after Epstein's death it was learned that Australian [[Robert Stigwood]] was trying to get hold of NEMS.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=191}} All four Beatles were not in favour such an outcome, as McCartney had previously told Epstein in 1967:&lt;ref name=&quot;BeatleMoneyMcCartneyExpenses&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlemoney.com/paul6467.htm |title=Paul McCartney: Expenses |publisher=Beatle Money |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We said, 'In fact, if you do, if you somehow manage to pull this off, we can promise you one thing. We will record ''God Save the Queen'' for every single record we make from now on and we'll sing it out of tune. That's a promise. So if this guy buys us, that's what he's buying'&quot;.|}}They hurried to set up Apple instead, and seeing that The Beatles would not be part of the NEMS package, Stigwood went to form his own company, [[RSO Records]]. The logo was designed by Gene Mahon, with illustrator [[Alan Aldridge]] transcribing the [[copyright|copyright notice]] to appear on record releases. In January 1968, Beatles Ltd. officially changed its name to Apple Corps. Ltd. and registered the Apple trademark in forty-seven countries &lt;ref&gt;Granados, M. Those Were the Days. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In February the company also registered Apple Electronics, Apple Films Ltd., Apple Management, Apple Music Publishing, Apple Overseas, Apple Publicity, Apple Records, Apple Retail, and Apple Tailoring Civil and Theatrical with the intent on focusing on five divisions: records, electronics, film, publishing and retailing.

Lennon and McCartney introduced their new business concept on a press conference held on 14 May 1968 in New York City, with McCartney saying it would be, &quot;A beautiful place where you can buy beautiful things… a controlled weirdness… a kind of Western communism&quot;.{{sfn|Carlin|2009|p=171}}&lt;ref name=&quot;UncontrolledWeirdness&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newint.org/features/1990/10/05/weirdness/ |title=Uncontrolled Weirdness|publisher=[[New Internationalist]] |date=October 1990 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon said, &quot;It's a company we're setting up, involving records, films, and electronics, and – as a sideline – manufacturing or whatever. We want to set up a system where people who just want to make a film about anything, don't have to go on their knees in somebody's office, probably yours&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LennonMcCartneyApplePressConference&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1968.0514pc.beatles.html |title=John Lennon &amp; Paul McCartney: Apple Press Conference|publisher=Beatles Interviews |date=14 May 1968 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney also said: &quot;It's just trying to mix business with enjoyment. We're in the happy position of not needing any more money. So for the first time, the bosses aren't in it for profit. We've already bought all our dreams. We want to share that possibility with others&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LennonMcCartneyApplePressConference&quot;/&gt;

=== Early administration ===
For the first few months of Apple's existence, it did not even have an office. Most of the company's business was conducted from the NEMS building. It was not until the autumn of 1967 that Apple finally opened a London office. Since the Beatles already owned a four-story building at 94 Baker Street that had been purchased as an investment property by their accountants, they decided that Baker Street was as good a location as any for Apple. In September they set up an office for Apple Publishing in the Baker Street building. With Epstein's death, there was nobody in The Beatles' inner circle with business acumen who could manage the company, and, as with their band affairs, The Beatles decided that they would manage it themselves. 

In December 1967, shortly after Epstein's death, Lennon asked Alistair Taylor to work as General Manager for Apple. It was during this period that Taylor appeared in the famous advertisement to promote Apple asking for new artists. Designed by Paul, it showed him disguised as a one-man band, claiming: &quot;This man has talent...&quot; The publication in the [[New Musical Express]] and [[Rolling Stone]], brought an avalanche of applicants. The mail room, telephone switchboard, and conference rooms became jammed at all hours with &quot;artists&quot; begging The Beatles to give them money. [[George Harrison]] would later lament that &quot;We had every freak in the world coming in there&quot;. Many of these supplicants received the investments they sought and were never heard from again.
[[Image:Alistair talent.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Taylor in the &quot;one-man band advertisement&quot;]]
Even though Apple was declared the most successful new record company of the year for 1968 before long the band members' ignorance of finance and administration combined with their naive, utopian mission of funding struggling, unknown artists left Apple Corps with no solid business plan.

The Beatles' naivety and inability to keep track of their own accounts was also eagerly exploited by the employees of Apple, who purchased drugs and alcoholic beverages, company lunches at expensive London restaurants, and international calls made regularly on office telephones, all of which would be treated as business expenses. Writers [[Alan Clayson]] and [[Spencer Leigh (radio presenter)|Spencer Leigh]] described the owners' hopelessness in managing their own creation:
{{Quote|Out of his depth, a Beatle might commandeer a room at Saville Row, stick to conventional office hours and play company director until the novelty wore off. Initially, he'd look away from the disgusting realities of the half-eaten steak sandwich in a litter bin; the employee rolling a spliff of best Afghan hash; the typist who span out a single letter (in the house style, with no exclamation marks!) all morning before 'popping out' and not returning until the next day. A great light dawned. 'We had, like, a thousand people that weren't needed,' snarled Ringo, 'but they all enjoyed it. They were all getting paid for sitting around. We had a guy there just to read the tarot cards, the ''I Ching''. It was craziness&quot;.{{sfn|Clayson|Leigh|2003|p=256}}}}
Aspinall finally agreed to direct the company on a temporary basis, simply so that someone would finally be in charge. When, in 1969, The Beatles engaged Klein as their manager, he also inherited the chairmanship of Apple Corps, which led to an immediate streamlining of company affairs: &quot;Overnight, glib lack of concern deferred to pointed questions,&quot; wrote Clayson &amp; Leigh. &quot;Which typist rings Canberra every afternoon? Why has so-and-so given himself a raise of 60 pounds a week? Why is he seen only on payday? Suddenly, lunch meant beans-on-toast in the office kitchen instead of Beluga caviar from [[Fortnum &amp; Mason]]&quot;.{{sfn|Clayson|Leigh|2003|p=257}}

=== Beatles break-up and beyond ===
The first two years of the company's existence also coincided with a marked worsening of the band members' relationships with each other, ultimately leading to the break-up of the band in 1970. Apple quickly slid into financial chaos, which was resolved only after many years of litigation. When The Beatles' partnership was dissolved in 1975, dissolution of Apple Corps was also considered, but it was decided to keep it going, while effectively retiring all its divisions. The company is currently headquartered at 27 Ovington Square, in London's prestigious [[Knightsbridge]] district. Ownership and control of the company remains with McCartney, Starr and the estates of Lennon and Harrison.

Apple Corps has had a long history of [[Apple Corps v. Apple Computer|trademark disputes]] with [[Apple Computer]] (now [[Apple Inc.]]). The dispute was finally resolved in 2007, with Apple Corps transferring ownership of the &quot;Apple&quot; name and all associated trademarks to Apple Inc., and Apple Inc. exclusively licensing these back to The Beatles' company. In April 2007, Apple also settled a long running dispute with [[EMI]] and announced the retirement of chief executive, Aspinall.&lt;ref name=&quot;MagicalTour&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first=Allan |last=Kozinn |title=Magical Mystery Tour Ends for Apple Corps Executive |work=[[New York Times]] |date=12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EMISettlement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=17737&amp;pagtype=allchandate |title=EMI, Apple Corps deal good news for iTunes? |first=Jonny  |last=Evans|publisher=Macworld |date=12 Apr 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspinall was replaced by [[Jeff Jones (music industry executive)|Jeff Jones]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Beatlesfriendquits&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-beatles/27612 |title=Beatles' friend quits top job at Apple Corps |publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=10 April 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsidiaries==
Apple Corps operated in various fields, mostly related to the music business and other media, through a number of subsidiaries.

===Apple Electronics===
'''Apple Electronics''' was the electronics division of Apple Corps, founded as Fiftyshapes Ltd., at 34 Boston Place, Westminster, London. It was headed by Beatles' associate Yanni Alexis Mardas, whom Lennon had nicknamed [[Magic Alex]].{{sfn|Blaney|2005|p=23}} Intending to revolutionise the consumer electronics market, largely through products based on Mardas' unique and, as it turned out, commercially impractical, designs, the electronics division did not make any breakthroughs. After the dismissal of Mardas in 1969, during Klein's 'house-cleaning' of Apple Corps, Apple Electronics fell victim to the same forces that troubled the company as a whole, including the impending Beatles' break-up. It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost The Beatles at least £300,000 (approximately three million British pounds today).&lt;ref name=&quot;CampbellNewStatesman&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first=Duncan |last=Campbell |title=Alex Mardas|work=[[New Statesman]] |date=3 August 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MeasuringWorth&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/ |title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to 2007 |publisher=Measuring Worth |accessdate=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Apple Films.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Apple Films logo, from the DVD release of ''[[Born To Boogie]]''.]]

===Apple Films===
'''Apple Films''' is the film-making division of Apple Corps. Its first production was The Beatles 1967 TV movie ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''. [[The Beatles]]' films ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', and ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let it Be]]'' were also produced under Apple Films. Other notable releases included ''[[Born to Boogie]]'', ([[Ringo Starr]]'s 1972 documentary about the band [[T.Rex (band)|T.Rex]]), ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh]]'', and ''[[Son of Dracula (1974 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' (a 1974 horror-musical which teamed Starr with singer [[Harry Nilsson]]). [[George Harrison]] was the executive producer for the Apple Films' ''[[Little Malcolm|Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs]]'' that included the Dark Horse Records band [[Splinter (band)|Splinter]]'s song &quot;Lonely Man&quot;. Apple Films was also responsible for producing Apple Corps' televised promotions.

===Apple Publishing===
Apple's [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]] arm predated even the record company. In September 1967, the first artistes to be signed by Apple Publishing were two songwriters from Liverpool. Paul Tennant and David Rhodes were offered a contract after meeting McCartney in Hyde Park.{{sfn|Tennant|Willis|2008|p=62}} They were advised to form a band by Epstein after he and Lennon heard their demos, calling the group Focal Point.{{sfn|Tennant|Willis|2008|p=125}} Epstein was to have managed the band but died before he could become involved. Terry Doran MD of Apple Publishing became their manager and they were signed by Deram Records.{{sfn|Tennant|Willis|2008|p=174}} Apple published the group's self-penned songs from early 1968.{{sfn|Tennant|Willis|2008|p=102}} Another early band on its publishing roster was the group [[Grapefruit (band)|Grapefruit]].{{sfn|Tennant|Willis|2008|p=170}} 

Apple Publishing Ltd. was also used as a publishing stop-gap by Harrison and Starr, as they sought to shift control of their own songs away from [[Northern Songs]], in which their status was little more than paid writers. (Harrison later started [[Harrisongs]], and Starr created [[Startling Music]]). Apple's greatest publishing successes were the [[Badfinger]] hits &quot;[[No Matter What (Badfinger song)|No Matter What]]&quot;, &quot;[[Day After Day (song)|Day After Day]]&quot; and &quot;[[Baby Blue (Badfinger song)|Baby Blue]]&quot;, all written by group member [[Pete Ham]], and Badfinger's &quot;[[Without You (Badfinger song)|Without You]]&quot;, a song penned by Ham and Badfinger band mate [[Tom Evans (musician)|Tom Evans]]. &quot;Without You&quot; became a worldwide #1 chart hit for [[Harry Nilsson]] in 1972 and [[Mariah Carey]] in 1993. In 2005, however, Apple lost the US publishing rights for the work of Ham and Evans.{{sfn|Matovina|2000}}

Apple also undertook publishing duties, at various times, for other Apple artists, including [[Yoko Ono]], [[Billy Preston]] and the [[Radha Krsna Temple]]. Apple received a large number of demo tapes; some songs were published, some were issued on other labels and only [[Benny Gallagher]] &amp; Lyle were retained as in-house writers before going on to co-found [[McGuinness Flint]]. Many of these demos have been collected on three Cherry Red CDs, entitled ''94 Baker Street'',&lt;ref name=&quot;94BakerStreet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0000BZYRA |title=94 Baker Street: The Pop Psych Sounds of the Apple Era 67-69|publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |date=20 October 2003 |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''An Apple for the Day'',&lt;ref name=&quot;AnAppleaDay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000EMTHJE |title=An Apple a Day|publisher=Rpm |date=10 April 2006 |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Treacle Toffee World''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TreacleToffeeWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001FNMVM6 |title=Treacle Toffee World: Further Adventures Into the Pop Psych Sounds from the Apple Era 1967-1969|publisher=Rpm |date=27 October 2008 |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple Books actually put out only one book in early 1970, which was the book that accompanied the initial pressing of the ''[[Let It Be]]'' album entitled, &quot;The Beatles [[Get Back]]&quot; containing photographs by [[Ethan Russell]] and text by [[Rolling Stone]] writers Jonathan Cott and David Dalton. Although the book was credited to Apple Publishing, all of the work on the project was actually done by freelancers. &lt;ref&gt;Granados, S. Those Were the Days. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Yesterday' by Robert Freeman&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Many Years From Now' by Miles, 'In My Life' by Pete Shotton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The complete EMI Recording Sessions' by Mark Lewisohn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Beatles London' by Mark Lewisohn and Peter Schreuder.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple Records and Zapple Records===
{{Main|Apple Records}}
From 1968 onwards, new releases by The Beatles were issued by [[Apple Records]], although the copyright remained with EMI, and Parlophone/Capitol catalogue numbers continued to be used. Apple releases of recordings by artists other than The Beatles, however, used a new set of numbers, and the copyrights were held mostly by Apple Corps Ltd.  More than a &quot;vanity label&quot;, Apple Records developed an eclectic roster of their own, releasing records by artists as diverse as Indian sitar guru [[Ravi Shankar]], Welsh easy listening songstress [[Mary Hopkin]], the power-pop band [[Badfinger]], classical music composer [[John Tavener]], soul singer [[Billy Preston]], folk singer [[James Taylor]], R&amp;B singer [[Doris Troy]], New York underground rock band [[Elephant's Memory]], original bad girl of rock and roll [[Ronnie Spector]], rock singer [[Jackie Lomax]], the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]], and even London's [[Radha Krsna Temple]]. 

Since Apple's inception, McCartney and Lennon had been very interested in launching a budget-line label to issue what would essentially be known three decades later as &quot;audio books&quot;. In October 1968, Apple hired Barry Miles, who co-owned the Indica bookshop with John Dunbar and Peter Asher, to manage the proposed spoken-word label. The initial idea of [[Apple Records#Zapple Records|Zapple Records]] was that it would release avant-garde and spoken word records at a reduced price that would be comparable to that of a paperback novel. While the idea looked good on paper, the reality was that when the few records actually put out by Zapple finally made it into the shops, they were priced like any other full-priced music album.&lt;ref&gt;Granados, S. Those Were the Days. p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Zapple Records was started on 3 February 1969, but after Klein was brought in to run Apple Corps' affairs, it was closed down after just two releases: Lennon's and Yoko Ono's ''[[Unfinished Music No.2: Life with the Lions|Life with the Lions]]'', and Harrison's ''[[Electronic Sound]]''.{{sfn|Blaney|2005|p=15}}

===Apple Retail===
{{Main|Apple Boutique}}
The '''Apple Boutique''' was a [[retail store]], located at 94 [[Baker Street]] in [[London]], [[England]], and was one of the first business ventures by the fledgling Apple Corps. Lennon's schoolfriend, [[Pete Shotton]] was hired as manager and the Dutch design collective [[The Fool (design collective)|The Fool]] were brought in to design the store and much of the merchandise.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=218}} The store opened to much fanfare on 7 December 1967, with Lennon and Harrison attending (Starr was filming, and McCartney was on holiday). The boutique was, however, never profitable, largely due to [[shoplifting]], by customers and its own staff.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=239}} After Shotton resigned, John Lyndon took over but even his management skills could not save the enterprise.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=238}} The store's remaining stock was liquidated by giving it away, but not before the individual Beatles took whatever they liked the night before its closure.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=239}} The boutique closed its doors for the last time on 31 July 1968.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=238}}

===Apple Studio===
'''Apple Studio''' was a [[recording studio]], located in the basement of the Apple Corps headquarters at 3 [[Savile Row]].

Originally designed by Mardas, of Apple Electronics, the initial installation proved to be unworkable, with almost no standard studio features such as a [[patch bay]], or a [[talkback (recording)|talkback]] system between the studio and the [[control room]], let alone Alex's promised innovations, and had to be scrapped. The Beatles recorded and filmed portions of their album ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'' in the Apple Studio, with equipment borrowed from [[EMI]], and during takes they had to shut down the building's central heating, also located in the basement, because the lack of [[soundproofing]] allowed the heating system to be heard in the studio. The redesign and rebuilding of the basement to accommodate proper recording facilities was overseen by former EMI engineer [[Geoff Emerick]], and took eighteen months. 

The studio reopened on 30 September 1971 and included its own natural [[echo chamber]], a wide range of recording and mastering facilities, and could turn out mono, stereo and [[quadrophonic]] master tapes and discs. In 1971, it would have cost £37 an hour to record to 16 track, £29 an hour to mix to stereo, and £12 to cut a 12” master. The studio became a second home for [[Apple Records]] artists, although they also used [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]] and other studios, and other artists such as [[Harry Nilsson]], [[Wishbone Ash]], [[Viv Stanshall]], [[Stealer's Wheel]], [[Lou Reizner]], [[Clodagh Rodgers]], and [[Marc Bolan]], as shown in the movie ''[[Born To Boogie]]'', also worked there. The existence of [[acetate disc|acetates]] by numerous performers is evidence the studio was widely used. The studio was closed down for good on 16 May 1975.

==Legal battles==
===Apple Corps versus Apple Computer===
{{Main|Apple Corps v. Apple Computer}}
In 1978, Apple Records filed suit against [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] (now Apple Inc.) for trademark infringement. The suit was settled in 1981 with the payment of $80,000 to Apple Corps. As a condition of the settlement, Apple Computer agreed to stay out of the music business. A dispute subsequently arose in 1989 when Apple Corps sued, alleging that Apple Computer's machines' ability to play back [[MIDI]] music was a violation of the 1981 settlement agreement. In 1991 another settlement, of around $26.5 million, was reached.&lt;ref name=&quot;ApplevsApple&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Apple-vs.-Apple-Perfect-harmony/2100-1027_3-5378401.html |title=Apple vs. Apple: Perfect harmony? |first=John |last=Borland |first2=Ina |last2=Fried|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=23 September 2004 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AppleCorpsvAppleComputer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article714550.ece |title=Apple Corps v Apple Computer: judgment in full|page=1|publisher=[[Times Newspapers Ltd]] |date=8 May 2006 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2003, Apple Computer was again sued by Apple Corps, this time for introducing the [[iTunes Store|iTunes Music Store]] and the [[iPod]], which Apple Corps asserted was a violation of Apple's agreement not to distribute music. The trial opened on 29 March 2006 in the UK,&lt;ref name=&quot;Applegiantsdobattle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4854408.stm |title=Apple giants do battle in court |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=29 March 2006 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a judgment issued on 8 May 2006, Apple Corps lost the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;AppleCorpsvAppleComputer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AppleComputerWins&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002464164 |title=Apple Computer Triumphs In Beatle Case|date=8 May 2006|publisher=[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--In opening arguments, Apple Corps' lawyer said that in 2003, shortly before the launch of Apple's on-line music store, Apple Corps rejected a $1 million offer from Apple Computer to buy the rights to use the Apple mark on the iTunes store.--&gt;

On 5 February 2007, Apple Inc. and Apple Corps announced a settlement of their trademark dispute under which Apple Inc. took ownership of all of the trademarks related to &quot;Apple&quot; (including all designs of the famed &quot;Granny Smith&quot; Apple Corps Ltd. logos),&lt;ref name=&quot;AppleIncscorestrademarkcoup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/04/12/apple_inc_scores_trademark_coup_with_beatles_label_logos.html |title=Apple Inc. scores trademark coup with Beatles' label logos |first=Aidan |last=Malley |first2=Kasper |last2=Jade|publisher=Apple Insider |date=12 April 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will license certain of those trademarks back to Apple Corps for their continued use. The settlement ends the ongoing trademark lawsuit between the companies, with each party bearing its own legal costs, and Apple Inc. will continue using its name and logos on iTunes. The settlement includes terms that are confidential.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/02/05Apple-Inc-and-The-Beatles-Apple-Corps-Ltd-Enter-into-New-Agreement.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NewAgreement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/02/05apple.html |title=Apple Inc. and The Beatles’ Apple Corps Ltd.

The website for [[Harmonix Music Systems|Harmonix's]] ''[[The Beatles: Rock Band]]'' video game is notable as the first evidence of the [[Apple Inc.|Apple, Inc.]]/Apple Corps Ltd. settlement: &quot;Apple Corps&quot; is prominently referred to throughout, and the &quot;Granny Smith&quot; Apple logo appears but the text beneath the logo now reads &quot;Apple Corps&quot; rather than the previous &quot;Apple&quot;. The website's acknowledgements specifically state that &quot;'Apple' and the 'Apple logo' are exclusively licensed to Apple Corps Ltd&quot;.

On 16 November 2010, Apple Inc. launched an extensive advertising campaign that announced the availability of The Beatles' entire catalogue on [[iTunes]].

===Apple versus EMI===
The Beatles alleged in a 1979 lawsuit that [[EMI]] and Capitol had underpaid the band by more than £10.5 million. A settlement was reached in that case in 1989, which granted the band an increased royalty rate and required EMI and Capitol to follow more stringent auditing requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMIBeatlesCourtBattles&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4535330.stm |title=Beatles sue EMI in royalties row |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=16 December 2005 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple, on behalf of the surviving Beatles and relatives of the band's late members, again [[lawsuit|sued]] [[EMI]] for unpaid [[royalties]], in a case beginning in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMIBeatlesCourtBattles&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BeatlessueEMIformillions&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article623632.ece |title=Beatles to sue EMI for millions in royalties|publisher=[[Times Newspapers Ltd]] |date=31 August 2006 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was settled in April 2007 with a &quot;mutually acceptable&quot; conclusion, which remained confidential.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMISettlement&quot;/&gt;

===Apple versus Nike/EMI===

In July 1987 Apple Corps sued [[Nike Inc]], [[Wieden+Kennedy]] (Nike's advertisement agency), [[EMI]] and [[Capitol Records]] for the use of the song &quot;[[Revolution (song)|Revolution]]&quot; in a 1987 
Nike commercial. Apple claimed that it was not informed of the use of the song and was not paid for continued use and therefore sued the four companies for $15 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nike&amp;TheBeatles&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/?tag=the-beatles-vs-nike |title=Nike &amp; The Beatles|publisher=The Pop History Dig, LLC |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMI countered stating that the case was 'groundless' to their claim they had the &quot;active support and encouragement of Yoko Ono Lennon&quot;, who owns 25% of Apple Corps through Lennon's estate, and was quoted as saying: &quot;[The commercial] is making John’s music accessible to a new generation&quot;. Apple's lawyer responded by stating that Apple can not take action unless all four shares are in agreement, meaning that Ono must have supported the idea to take legal action at the moment when the decision was made. Harrison had the following to say about the unauthorised use of Beatles songs for advertisement as well as the importance of this particular case: 
{{Quote|''[E]very Beatles song ever recorded is going to be advertising women’s underwear and sausages.  We’ve got to put a stop to it in order to set a precedent. Otherwise it’s going to be a free-for-all. It’s one thing when you’re dead, but we’re still around!  They don’t have any respect for the fact that we wrote and recorded those songs, and it was our lives.''}}
On 9 November 1989, the lawsuit was settled out-of-court. As with previous cases between Apple and EMI, a condition of the settlement was that terms of the agreement would be kept secret. It was suggested, however, by a spokesman of Ono that in the end of a very &quot;confusing myriad of issues&quot; there was a large exchange of money. Nike had also ceased to use the song for advertisement in March 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;WithoutAppleRecordsPermission&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feelnumb.com/?p=4137 |title=Nike Was Sued For 1987 Commercial That Used The Beatles &quot;Revolution&quot; Without Apple Records Permission|publisher=Feel Numb |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Apple consolidated its multiple consumer-level desktop models into the [[iMac G3|1998 iMac]] all-in-one. This proved to be a sales success and saw the Macintosh brand revitalized. Current Mac systems are mainly targeted at the home, education, and creative professional markets. These include the descendants of the original [[iMac]] and the entry-level [[Mac mini]] [[Desktop computer|desktop models]], the [[Mac Pro]] tower [[computer graphics|graphics]] [[workstation]], the [[MacBook]], [[MacBook Air]] and [[MacBook Pro]] laptops. The [[Xserve]] [[server (computing)|server]] was discontinued January 31, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;xserve discontinue pdf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.apple.com/xserve/pdf/L422277A_Xserve_Guide.pdf |title=Xserve Transition Guide |date=November 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of the Mac is based on a [[vertical integration]] model in that Apple facilitates all aspects of its hardware and creates its own [[operating system]] that is pre-installed on all Mac computers. This is in contrast to most [[IBM PC compatible]]s, where multiple sellers create and integrate hardware intended to run another company's operating software. Apple exclusively produces Mac hardware, choosing [[Personal computer hardware|internal systems]], [[industrial design|designs]], and prices. Apple does use third party components, however, such as graphics subsystems from [[nVidia]] and [[ATi]]. Current Mac [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] use [[Intel]]'s [[X86-64]] architecture; the earliest models (1984–1994) used [[Motorola]]'s [[68k]] and models from 1994–2006 used the [[AIM alliance]]'s [[PowerPC]]. Apple also develops the operating system for the Mac, currently [[Mac OS X]] version [[Mac OS X v10.7|10.7 &quot;Lion&quot;]]. The modern Mac, like other personal computers, is capable of running alternative operating systems such as [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], and, in the case of Intel-based Macs, [[Microsoft Windows]]. However, Apple does not [[Software license agreement|license]] Mac OS X for use on non-Apple computers.

===1979 to 1984: Development===
The Macintosh project started in the late 1970s with [[Jef Raskin]], an Apple employee who envisioned an easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer. He wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mxmora.best.vwh.net/JefRaskin.html|title=Recollections of the Macintosh project|accessdate=November 27, 2008|first=Jef|last=Raskin|year=1996|work=Articles from Jef Raskin about the history of the Macintosh.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the name had to be changed for legal reasons as it was too close, phonetically, to that of the [[McIntosh Laboratory|McIntosh audio equipment]] manufacturer. [[Steve Jobs]] requested a release of the name so that Apple could use it, but was denied, forcing Apple to eventually buy the rights to use the name.&lt;ref&gt;Apple confidential 2.0: the definitive history of the world's most colorful company, Owen W. Linzmayer, ISBN 978-1-59327-010-0&lt;/ref&gt; Raskin was authorized to start hiring for the project in September 1979,&lt;ref name=&quot;Father of Mac&quot;/&gt; and he began to look for an engineer who could put together a prototype. [[Bill Atkinson]], a member of Apple's [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] team (which was developing a similar but higher-end computer), introduced him to [[Burrell Smith]], a service technician who had been hired earlier that year. Over the years, Raskin assembled a large development team that designed and built the original Macintosh hardware and [[Computer software|software]]; besides Raskin, Atkinson and Smith, the team included [[George Crow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crow|first=George|publisher=Folklore.org|authorlink=Jerry Manock|url=http://www.folklore.org/ProjectView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;characters=George%20Crow|title=The Original Macintosh|accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Espinosa]], [[Joanna Hoffman]], [[Bruce Horn]], [[Susan Kare]], [[Andy Hertzfeld]], [[Guy Kawasaki]], [[Daniel Kottke]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kottke|first=Dan|publisher=Folklore.org|authorlink=Jerry Manock|url=http://www.folklore.org/ProjectView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;characters=Dan%20Kottke|title=The Original Macintosh|accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jerry Manock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manock|first=Jerry|publisher=Folklore.org|authorlink=Jerry Manock|url=http://folklore.org/ProjectView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;characters=Jerry%20Manock|title=The Original Macintosh|accessdate=April 28, 2010|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929111006/http://folklore.org/ProjectView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;characters=Jerry%20Manock |archivedate = September 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2009/01/twenty-five-yea.html#axzz0mQb8tIS0|title=Macintosh 25th Anniversary Reunion: Where Did Time Go?|date=January 26, 2009|accessdate=April 28, 2010|first=Guy|last=Kawasaki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Espinosa, Hoffman, Kare, Hertzfeld, Kawasaki--&gt;

Smith's first Macintosh board was built to Raskin's design specifications: it had 64&amp;nbsp;[[kilobytes]] (kB) of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], used the [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 6809|6809E]] [[microprocessor]], and was capable of supporting a 256×256 [[pixel]] [[black-and-white]] [[Raster graphics|bitmap]] display. [[Bud Tribble]], a Macintosh programmer, was interested in running the Lisa's graphical programs on the Macintosh, and asked Smith whether he could incorporate the Lisa's [[Motorola 68000]] microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000, but increased its speed from 5&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] to 8&amp;nbsp;MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256 pixel display. Smith's design used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made production of the board significantly more cost-efficient. The final Mac design was self-contained and had the complete [[QuickDraw]] picture language and interpreter in 64 kB of [[read-only memory|ROM]]&amp;nbsp;– far more than most other computers; it had 128&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64&amp;nbsp;[[kilobit]] (kb) RAM chips [[solder]]ed to the [[motherboard|logicboard]]. Though there were no memory slots, its RAM was expandable to 512&amp;nbsp;kB by means of soldering sixteen [[Integrated circuit|IC]] sockets to accept 256&amp;nbsp;kb RAM chips in place of the factory-installed chips. The final product's screen was a 9-inch, 512x342 pixel [[monochrome]] display, exceeding the prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hertzfeld|first=Andy|publisher=Folklore.org|authorlink=Andy Hertzfeld|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Five_Different_Macs.txt|title=Five different Macintoshes|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This sources the entire paragraph.--&gt;

The design caught the attention of [[Steve Jobs]], co-founder of Apple. Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, he began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin finally left the Macintosh project in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs, and team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs' ideas than Raskin's.&lt;ref name=&quot;Father of Mac&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Hertzfeld|first=Andy|authorlink=Andy Hertzfeld|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=The_Father_of_The_Macintosh.txt&amp;showcomments=1#comments|publisher=Folklore.org|title=The father of the Macintosh|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing of the pioneering GUI technology being developed at [[Xerox PARC]], Jobs had negotiated a visit to see the [[Xerox Alto]] computer and [[Smalltalk]] development tools in exchange for Apple stock options. The Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at Xerox PARC and were combined with the Macintosh group's own ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horn|first=Bruce|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=On_Xerox,_Apple_and_Progress.txt|publisher=Folklore.org|title=On Xerox, Apple and Progress|accessdate=February 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs also commissioned industrial designer [[Hartmut Esslinger]] to work on the Macintosh line, resulting in the [[Snow White design language|&quot;Snow White&quot; design language]]; although it came too late for the earliest Macs, it was implemented in most other mid- to late-1980s Apple computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tracy|first=Ed|url=http://www.landsnail.com/apple/local/design/design2.html|title=History of computer design: Snow White|publisher=Landsnail.com|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jobs' leadership at the Macintosh project did not last; after an internal power struggle with new CEO [[John Sculley]], Jobs resigned from Apple in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=The_End_Of_An_Era.txt|title=The End Of An Era|first=Andy|last=Hertzfeld|authorlink=Andy Hertzfeld|work=folklore.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; went on to found [[NeXT]], another computer company,&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|last=Spector|first=G|title=Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market|work=[[eWeek|PCWeek]]|page=109|date=September 24, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did not return until 1997 when Apple acquired NeXT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://product.info.apple.com/pr/press.releases/1997/q2/970207.pr.rel.next.html |title=Apple Computer, Inc.

===1984: Introduction===
[[File:Ad apple 1984.jpg|thumb|alt=A young woman carrying a sledge hammer and wearing a white tank top with a drawing of a Macintosh runs from black figures in the background.|[[1984 (television commercial)|This television commercial]], first aired during [[Super Bowl XVIII]], launched the original Macintosh.]]
The [[Macintosh 128K]] was announced to the press in October 1983, followed by an 18-page brochure included with various magazines in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digibarn.com/collections/ads/apple-mac/index.htm|title=Apple Macintosh 18 Page Brochure|publisher=DigiBarn Computer Museum|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Macintosh was introduced by the now famous US$1.5&amp;nbsp;million [[Ridley Scott]] television commercial, &quot;[[1984 (television commercial)|1984]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;appleconfidential2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Linzmayer|first=Owen W.|title=Apple Confidential 2.0|publisher=No Starch Press|year=2004|page=113|url=http://www.owenink.com|isbn=1-59327-010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial most notably aired during the third quarter of [[Super Bowl XVIII]] on January 22, 1984 and is now considered a &quot;watershed event&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2004-01-28-maney_x.htm|title=Apple's '1984' Super Bowl commercial still stands as watershed event|accessdate=April 11, 2010|last=Maney|first=Kevin|date=January 28, 2004|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a &quot;masterpiece.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;masterpiece&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/02/02/eye.ent.commercials/|title=Why 2006 isn't like '1984'|accessdate=May 10, 2008|last=Leopold|first=Todd|date=February 3, 2006|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;1984&quot; used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]-style picture of [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computer on her white [[sleeveless shirt|tank top]]) as a means of saving humanity from the &quot;conformity&quot; of IBM's attempts to dominate the computer industry. The ad [[allusion|alludes]] to [[George Orwell]]'s novel, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]],'' which described a [[dystopia|dystopian future]] ruled by a televised &quot;[[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cellini&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb197/is_200401/ai_n5556112|title=The Story Behind Apple's '1984' TV commercial: Big Brother at 20|accessdate=May 9, 2008|last=Cellini|first=Adelia|month=January|year=2004|work=[[MacWorld]] 21.1, page 18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080626112220/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb197/is_200401/ai_n5556112 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/01/72496|title=Jan. 22, 1984: Dawn of the Mac|accessdate=April 11, 2010|last=Long|first=Tony|date=January 22, 2007|publisher=[[Wired News|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after the 1984 ad aired, the Macintosh went on sale. It came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface: [[MacWrite]] and [[MacPaint]]. It was first demonstrated by Steve Jobs in the first of his famous Mac Keynote speeches, and though the Mac garnered an immediate, enthusiastic following, some labeled it a mere &quot;toy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2004/01/61730|title=We're All Mac Users Now|accessdate=April 11, 2010|last=Kahney|first=Leander|date=January 6, 2004|publisher=[[Wired News|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the operating system was designed largely around the GUI, existing text-mode and [[command line interface|command-driven applications]] had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten. This was a time-consuming task that many [[software developer]]s chose not to undertake, and could be regarded as a reason for an initial lack of software for the new system. In April 1984 [[Microsoft]]'s [[MultiPlan]] migrated over from [[MS-DOS]], with [[Microsoft Word]] following in January 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm|title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers|author=Polsson, Ken|accessdate=November 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, [[Lotus Software]] introduced [[Lotus Jazz]] for the Macintosh platform after the success of [[Lotus 1-2-3]] for the [[IBM PC]], although it was largely a flop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-11721498/lotus-third-time-charm.html|title=For Lotus, third time's the charm|author=Beamer, Scott|accessdate=June 23, 2010|date=January 13, 1992|publisher=MacWEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple introduced [[Macintosh Office]] the same year with the [[Lemmings (television commercial)|lemmings ad]]. Infamous for insulting its own potential customers, the ad was not successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worst Business&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Apple-Macintosh.jpg|thumb|alt=A Macintosh sits in a museum exhibit about postmodernism.|The Apple Macintosh Plus at the [[Röhsska Museum|Design Museum]] in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden.]]

For a special post-election edition of ''[[Newsweek]]'' in November 1984, Apple spent more than US$2.5&amp;nbsp;million to buy all 39 of the advertising pages in the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidebookgallery.org/ads/magazines/macos/macos10-newsweek|title=1984 ''Newsweek'' Macintosh ads|publisher=GUIdebook, [[Newsweek]]|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple also ran a &quot;Test Drive a Macintosh&quot; promotion, in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad shape that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from US$1,995 to US$2,495 (adjusting for inflation, about $5,200 in 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;Worst Business&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/16036/Apples-Worst-Business-Decisions/|title=Apple's Worst Business Decisions|author=Hormby, Thomas|publisher=OS News|accessdate=December 24, 2007|date=October 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl|title=Inflation Calculator|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]|accessdate=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1985 to 1989: Desktop publishing era===
In 1985, the combination of the Mac, Apple's [[LaserWriter]] printer, and Mac-specific software like Boston Software's [[MacPublisher]] and [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] enabled users to design, preview, and print page layouts complete with text and graphics—an activity to become known as [[desktop publishing]]. Initially, desktop publishing was unique to the Macintosh, but eventually became available for other platforms as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Spring | first = Michael B. | title = Electronic printing and publishing: the document processing revolution | publisher=CRC Press | year = 1991 | pages = 125–126 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=_MV46vFUrI4C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Desktop+publishing+history+of&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Desktop%20publishing%20history%20of | isbn = 9780824785444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, applications such as Macromedia FreeHand, [[QuarkXPress]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], and [[Adobe Illustrator]] strengthened the Mac's position as a graphics computer and helped to expand the emerging desktop publishing market.

The limitations of the first Mac soon became clear: it had very little memory, even compared with other personal computers in 1984, and could not be expanded easily; and it lacked a [[hard disk drive]] or the means to attach one easily. Many small companies sprang up to address the memory issue, by upgrading the 128k Mac to 512 kB, by removing the computer's 16 memory chips and replacing them with larger-capacity chips, a tedious operation that was not always successful. In October 1985, Apple increased the Mac's memory to 512&amp;nbsp;kB,&lt;ref name=&quot;512_specs&quot;&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh 512K]]|appleNumber=SP187|everyURL=mac_classic/stats/mac_512k.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered an upgrade for 128k Macs that involved replacing the logic board. In an attempt to improve connectivity, Apple released the [[Macintosh Plus]] on January 10, 1986 for US$2,600. It offered one [[megabyte]] of RAM, easily expandable to four by the use of [[SIMM|socketed RAM boards]], and a [[SCSI]] parallel interface, allowing up to seven peripherals—such as hard drives and scanners—to be attached to the machine. Its [[Macintosh External Disk Drive|floppy drive]] was increased to an 800&amp;nbsp;[[Kilobyte|kB]] capacity. The Mac Plus was an immediate success and remained in production, unchanged, until October 15, 1990; on sale for just over four years and ten months, it was the longest-lived Macintosh in Apple's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh Plus]]|appleNumber=SP190|everyURL=mac_classic/stats/mac_plus.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MacII.jpg|thumb|alt=A Macintosh II with a separate monitor and CPU.|The [[Macintosh II]], one of the first expandable Macintosh models.]]
Updated Motorola CPUs made a faster machine possible, and in 1987 Apple took advantage of the new Motorola technology and introduced the [[Macintosh II]], which used a {{nowrap|16&amp;nbsp;MHz}} [[Motorola 68020]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh II]]|appleNumber=SP193|everyURL=mac_ii/stats/mac_ii.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary improvement in the Macintosh II was Color [[QuickDraw]] in ROM, a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine. Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were an ability to handle any display size, any color depth, and multiple monitors.

The Macintosh II marked the start of a new direction for the Macintosh, as now for the first time it had an [[open architecture]] with several [[NuBus]] expansion slots, support for color graphics and external monitors, and a modular design similar to that of the IBM PC. It had an internal hard drive and a power supply with a fan, which was initially fairly loud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=160|title=Apple Macintosh II|accessdate=December 23, 2007|publisher=Old Computers On-line Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; One third-party developer sold a device to regulate fan speed based on a heat sensor, but it voided the warranty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA40560 |title=Macintosh II Family: Fan Regulator Voids Warranty|accessdate=December 23, 2007|publisher=Apple|date=July 2, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Macintosh computers had quieter power supplies and hard drives.

In September 1986, Apple introduced the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, or [[Macintosh Programmer's Workshop|MPW]] that allowed software developers to create software for Macintosh on Macintosh, rather than [[cross compiling]] from a Lisa. In August 1987, Apple unveiled [[HyperCard]], and introduced [[MultiFinder]], which added cooperative multitasking to the Macintosh. Apple began bundling both with every Macintosh.

The [[Macintosh SE]] was released at the same time as the Macintosh II, as the first [[Compact Macintosh|compact Mac]] with a 20&amp;nbsp;MB internal hard drive and one expansion slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh SE]]|appleNumber=SP191|everyURL=mac_classic/stats/mac_se.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SE's expansion slot was located inside the case along with the CRT, potentially exposing an upgrader to high voltage. For this reason Apple recommended users bring their SE to an authorized Apple dealer to have upgrades performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Service Source: Apple SE/30|accessdate=November 16, 2010|url=http://www.apple-collection.com/CarPos/macse30.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SE also updated [[Jerry Manock]] and Terry Oyama's original design and shared the Macintosh II's ''[[Snow White design language|Snow White]]'' design language, as well as the new [[Apple Desktop Bus]] (ADB) [[Apple Mouse#Apple Desktop Bus Mouse (G5431/A9M0331)|mouse]] and [[Apple Keyboard#Apple Keyboard (M0116)|keyboard]] that had first appeared on the [[Apple IIGS|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]] some months earlier.

In 1987, Apple spun off its software business as [[Claris]]. It was given the code and rights to several applications that had been written within Apple, notably MacWrite, MacPaint, and [[MacProject]]. In the late 1980s, Claris released a number of revamped software titles; the result was the &quot;Pro&quot; series, including MacDraw Pro, MacWrite Pro, and FileMaker Pro. To provide a complete office suite, Claris purchased the rights to the [[Informix Wingz]] [[spreadsheet]] on the Mac, renaming it [[Claris Resolve]], and added the new presentation software [[Claris Impact]]. By the early 1990s, Claris applications were shipping with the majority of consumer-level Macintoshes and were extremely popular. In 1991, Claris released [[AppleWorks|ClarisWorks]], which soon became their second best-selling application. When Claris was reincorporated back into Apple in 1998, ClarisWorks was renamed AppleWorks beginning with version 5.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=MIT Project on Mathematics and Computation|url=http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bob/clarisworks.php|title=A Brief History of ClarisWorks|accessdate=December 24, 2007|year=2003|author=Hearm, Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Apple [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.|sued]] Microsoft and [[Hewlett-Packard]] on the grounds that they infringed Apple's copyrighted GUI, citing (among other things) the use of rectangular, overlapping, and resizable windows. After four years, the case was decided against Apple, as were later [[United States court of appeals|appeals]]. Apple's actions were criticized by some in the software community, including the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF), who felt Apple was trying to monopolize on GUIs in general, and boycotted GNU software for the Macintosh platform for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Free Software Foundation]]|title=Special Report: Apple's New Look and Feel|url=http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull5.html#SEC9|journal=GNU's Bulletin|volume=1|issue=5|date= June 11, 1988 |accessdate=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Free Software Foundation]]|title=End of Apple Boycott|url=http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull18.html#SEC13|journal=GNU's Bulletin|volume=1|issue=18|date=1995-01|accessdate=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the new [[Motorola 68030]] processor came the [[Macintosh IIx]] in 1988, which had benefited from internal improvements, including an on-board [[memory management unit|MMU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh IIx]]|appleNumber=SP194|everyURL=mac_ii/stats/mac_iix.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed in 1989 by a more compact version with fewer slots (the [[Macintosh IIcx]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh IIcx]]|everyURL=apple/mac_ii/stats/mac_iicx.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a version of the Mac SE powered by the {{nowrap|16&amp;nbsp;MHz}} 68030, the [[Macintosh SE/30]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh SE/30]]|appleNumber=SP195|everyURL=mac_classic/stats/mac_se30.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the [[Macintosh IIci]], running at {{nowrap|25&amp;nbsp;MHz}}, was the first Mac to be &quot;[[32-bit clean]],&quot; allowing it to natively support more than 8&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh IIci]]|appleNumber=SP197|everyURL=mac_ii/stats/mac_iici.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike its predecessors, which had &quot;32-bit dirty&quot; ROMs (8 of the 32&amp;nbsp;bits available for addressing were used for OS-level [[Flag (computing)|flags]]).

[[Windows 3.0|Microsoft Windows 3.0]], which began to approach the Macintosh operating system in both performance and feature set,{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} was released in May 1990 and was a less expensive alternative to the Macintosh platform. Apple's response was to introduce a range of relatively inexpensive Macs in October 1990.

In 1994, Apple abandoned Motorola CPUs for the [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] PowerPC architecture developed by the [[AIM alliance]] of Apple Computer, IBM, and Motorola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaomso.com/FullStory.php?TheStory=78|title=Apple's Transition to PowerPC put in perspective|author=Hormby, Thomas|publisher=Kaomso|accessdate=December 24, 2007|date=January 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Power Macintosh]] line, the first to use the new chips, proved to be highly successful, with over a million PowerPC units sold in nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1994.htm|title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers|author=Polsson, Ken|accessdate=December 24, 2007|date=December 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple replaced the Macintosh Portable in 1991 with the first of the [[PowerBook]] line: the [[PowerBook 100]], a miniaturized Portable; the {{nowrap|16&amp;nbsp;MHz}} 68030 [[PowerBook 140]]; and the {{nowrap|25&amp;nbsp;MHz}} 68030 [[PowerBook 170]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1990.htm|title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers|author=Polsson, Ken|accessdate=November 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first portable computers with the keyboard behind a palm rest, and with a built-in pointing device (a [[trackball]]) in front of the keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/02/16/apple_to_re_enter_the_sub_notebook_market.html|title=Apple to re-enter the sub-notebook market|author=Jade, Kasper|publisher=AppleInsider|accessdate=December 24, 2007|date=February 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 [[PowerBook 165c]] was Apple's first portable computer to feature a color screen, displaying 256 colors with {{nowrap|640 x 400}} pixel resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=PowerBook 165c|appleNumber=SP148|everyURL=powerbook/stats/mac_powerbook165c.html|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second-generation of PowerBooks, the 68040-equipped [[PowerBook 500 series|500 series]], introduced the [[trackpad]], integrated stereo speakers and built-in [[Ethernet]] to the laptop form factor in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=PowerBook 520|appleNumber=SP160|everyURL=powerbook/stats/mac_powerbook520.html|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for [[Mac OS]], [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]] was a [[32-bit]] rewrite from [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] to [[C++]] that introduced [[virtual memory]], and improved the handling of color graphics, memory addressing, networking, and [[co-operative multitasking]]. Also during this time, the Macintosh began to shed the &quot;Snow White&quot; design language, along with the expensive consulting fees they were paying to [[Frogdesign]], in favor of bringing the work in-house by establishing the [[Apple Industrial Design Group]]. They became responsible for to crafting a new look to go with the new operating system and all other Apple products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kunkel|first=Paul|others=Rick English (photographs)|title=AppleDesign: The work of the Apple Industrial Design Group|date= October 1, 1997 |publisher=[[Graphis Inc.]]|location=New York City|isbn=1888001259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these technical and commercial successes, [[Microsoft]] and [[Intel]] began to rapidly lower Apple's [[market share]] with the [[Windows 95]] operating system and [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] processors respectively. These significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of [[IBM PC compatible]] computers, and brought Windows still closer to the Mac [[GUI]]. Furthermore, Apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers. At one point Apple's product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]], and [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] models, with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=12707 |title=Macintosh Centris, Quadra 660AV: Description (Discontinued)|author=Apple Computer|accessdate=December 24, 2007|date=June 19, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models competed against the [[Macintosh clone]]s, hardware manufactured by third-parties that ran Apple's System 7. This succeeded in increasing the Macintosh's market share somewhat and provided cheaper hardware for consumers, but hurt Apple financially as existing Apple customers began to buy cheaper clones while Apple shouldered the burden of developing the platform.

When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he ordered that the OS that had been previewed as version 7.7 be branded [[Mac OS 8]] (in place of the never-to-appear [[Copland (operating system)|Copland OS]]). Since Apple had licensed only System 7 to third-parties, this move effectively ended the clone line. The decision caused significant financial losses for companies like [[Motorola]], who produced the [[Motorola StarMax|StarMax]], Umax, who produced the SuperMac,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/umax/index-umax-supermac-mac-clones.html|title=Umax Mac Clones (MacOS-Compatible Systems)|author=EveryMac.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009|date=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Power Computing Corporation]], who offered several lines Mac clones, including PowerWave, PowerTower, and PowerTower Pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/powercc/index-power-computing-mac-clones.html|title=PowerComputing Mac Clones (MacOS-Compatible Systems)|author=EveryMac.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009|date=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies had invested substantial resources in creating their own Mac-compatible hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowendmac.com/musings/mm07/0830.html|title=1997: Apple Squeezes Mac Clones Out of the Market|author=Knight, Dan|publisher=Low End Mac|accessdate=December 24, 2007|date=August 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple bought out Power Computing's license, but allowed Umax to continue selling Mac clones until their license expired, as they had a sizeable presence in the lower-end segment that Apple did not.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===1998 to 2005: New beginnings===
[[Image:IMac Bondi Blue.jpg|thumb|The original &quot;Bondi Blue&quot; [[iMac G3]]. Introduced in 1998, it led Apple's return to profitability. However, the [[Apple USB Mouse|associated mouse]] proved to be one of consumers' least favorite Apple products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engst|first=Adam|title=The six worst Apple products of all time|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/138404/2009/01/macat25_worstproducts.html|publisher=Macworld|accessdate=May 14, 2010|date=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1998, a year after [[Steve Jobs]] had returned to the company, Apple introduced an all-in-one Macintosh called the [[iMac]]. Its translucent plastic case, originally [[Bondi blue]] and later many other colors, is considered an [[industrial design]] landmark of the late 1990s. The iMac did away with most of Apple's standard (and usually proprietary) connections, such as [[SCSI]] and [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]], in favor of two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports. It also had no internal [[floppy disk]] drive and instead included a [[CD-ROM]] drive for installing software,&lt;ref name=&quot;eight ways&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[iMac G3]]|appleNumber=SP136|everyURL=imac/stats/imac_ab.html|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was incapable of writing to CDs or other media without external third-party hardware. The iMac proved to be phenomenally successful, with 800,000 units sold in 139 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/ca/press/1999/01/iMac_Sales.html|title=800,000 iMacs Sold in First 139 Days|publisher=Apple|date=January 5, 1999|accessdate=December 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the company an annual profit of US$309&amp;nbsp;million—Apple's first profitable year since [[Michael Spindler]] took over as CEO in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6D8123AF936A25753C1A96E958260 |title=COMPANY REPORTS; Apple's First Annual Profit Since 1995|author=Markoff, John | authorlink = John Markoff |date=October 15, 1998|work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iMacs's &quot;blue and white&quot; aesthetic was applied to the [[Power Macintosh G3 (Blue &amp; White)|Power Macintosh]], and then to a new product, the [[iBook]]. Introduced in July 1999, the iBook was Apple's first consumer-level laptop computer, filling the missing quadrant of Apple's &quot;four-square product matrix&quot; (''desktop'' and ''portable'' products for both ''consumers'' and ''professionals'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://db.tidbits.com/article/5487?print_version=1|title=iBook: An iMac to Go}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 140,000 pre-orders were placed before it started shipping in September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macobserver.com/news/99/august/990831/140000ibooks.html|title=Apple Averages Three Thousand iBooks Per Day In Pre-orders!|date=August 31, 1999|publisher=The Mac Observer|accessdate=December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by October it was as much a sales hit as the iMac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2000/jan/25ibook.html|title=PC Data Ranks iBook Number One Portable in U.S.|date=January 25, 2000|publisher=Apple|accessdate=December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2001, Apple began shipping computers with [[CDRW]] drives for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcworld.about.com/news/Jan092001id37951.htm|title=Speed, Song Highlight Apple Product Announcements}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple had been emphasizing the Mac's ability to play DVDs by including [[DVD-ROM]] and [[DVD-RAM]] drives as standard. Steve Jobs admitted that Apple had been &quot;late to the party&quot; on writable CD technology but felt that Macs could become a &quot;digital hub&quot; that linked and enabled an &quot;emerging digital lifestyle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Apple-picks-up-the-beat-with-CD-RW-drives/2100-1040_3-249578.html|title=Apple picks up the beat with CD-RW drives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple would later introduce an update to its [[iTunes]] music player software that could burn CDs, along with a controversial &quot;Rip, Mix, Burn&quot; advertising campaign that some&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.macworld.com/article/3744/2002/03/eisner2.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; felt encouraged [[media piracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maclife.com/article/feature/complete_itunes_history_soundjam_mp_itunes_9|title=The Complete iTunes History – SoundJam MP to iTunes 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accompanied the release of the [[iPod]], Apple's first successful [[Mobile device|handheld device]].

Apple continued to add new products to their lineup, such as the [[Power Mac G4 Cube]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/PowerMacG4_CubeAbout.PDF|format=PDF|title=About the Macintosh Cube|year=2000|publisher=Apple|accessdate=October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[eMac]] for the education market and [[PowerBook G4]] laptop for professionals. The [[iMac G3|original iMac]] used a [[PowerPC G3|G3 processor]], but the [[iMac G4|G4]] and then [[iMac G5|G5]] chips were accompanied by successive new designs, dropping the array of colors in favor of white plastic. {{As of|2011}} [[iMac (Intel-based)|iMacs]] used aluminum enclosures. On January 11, 2005, Apple announced the release of the [[Mac Mini]] priced at US$499,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple Changes Course With Low-Priced Mac|first1=John|last1=Markoff|first2=Saul|last2=Hansell| authorlink = John Markoff | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/12/technology/12apple.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=January 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the least expensive Mac at its release.&lt;ref name=BBCunveil&gt;{{Cite document|title=Apple unveils low-cost 'Mac mini'|publisher=BBC News   |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4162009.stm|accessdate=April 28, 2010 | date=January 11, 2005|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mac OS continued to evolve up to version 9.2.2, including retrofits such as the addition of a [[nanokernel]] and support for [[Multi-core (computing)|Multiprocessing Services]] 2.0 in [[Mac OS 8.6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/PPCSoftware/PPCSoftware-12.html#HEADING12-0|title=Apple Developer Connection&amp;nbsp;– Overview of the PowerPC System Software|publisher=Apple|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately its dated architecture made replacement necessary. Initially developed in the [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] programming language, it was substantially rewritten in [[C++]] for System 7. From its beginnings on a 128k 8&amp;nbsp;MHz machine, it had grown to support Apple's latest 1&amp;nbsp;GHz G4-equipped Macs. But since its architecture was laid down, OS features like [[preemptive multitasking]] and [[protected memory]] had become feasible on the kind of hardware Apple manufactured – features that were already common on Apple's competition. As such, Apple introduced [[Mac OS X]], a fully overhauled [[Unix]]-based successor to [[Mac OS 9]], using [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], [[XNU]], and [[Mach kernel|Mach]] as [[Architecture of Mac OS X|foundations]], and based on [[NEXTSTEP]]. Mac OS X was not released to the public until September 2000, as the [[Mac OS X Public Beta]], with a revamped [[user interface]] Apple called &quot;[[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]]&quot;. At US$29.99, it allowed adventurous Mac users to sample Apple's new operating system and provide feedback for the actual release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple Breaks The Mold|first=J.D.|last=Biersdorfer|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E2DD1538F937A2575AC0A9669C8B63 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 14, 2000|accessdate=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial release of Mac OS X, [[Mac OS X v10.0|10.0]] (nicknamed Cheetah), was released on March 24, 2001. Older Mac OS applications could still run under early Mac OS X versions, using an environment called [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]]. Subsequent releases of Mac OS X were [[Mac OS X v10.1|10.1 &quot;Puma&quot;]] (September 25, 2001), [[Mac OS X v10.2|10.2 &quot;Jaguar&quot;]] (August 24, 2002), [[Mac OS X v10.3|10.3 &quot;Panther&quot;]] (October 24, 2003) and [[Mac OS X v10.4|10.4 &quot;Tiger&quot;]] (April 29, 2005).

===2006 onward: Intel era===
[[Image:MacBook Pro situated on a wooden table.jpg|thumb|The [[MacBook Pro]] is the first Mac notebook to use an Intel processor.

Apple [[Apple–Intel transition|discontinued]] the use of [[PowerPC]] microprocessors in 2006.

Intel chips introduced the potential to run the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]] natively on Apple hardware, without emulation software such as [[Microsoft Virtual PC|Virtual PC]]. In March 2006, a group of hackers announced that they were able to run [[Windows XP]] on an Intel-based Mac. The group released their software as open source and has posted it for download on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= March 17, 2006 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11885495/|title=Hackers get Windows XP to run on a Mac|publisher=[[MSNBC]] (AP)|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 5, 2006, Apple announced the public beta availability of their own [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] software that allows owners of Intel-based Macs to install Windows XP on their machines; later versions added support for [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]]. Boot Camp became a standard feature in Mac OS X 10.5, while support for Classic was dropped from PowerPC Macs.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple bcamp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Boot Camp|url=http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/|publisher=Apple|accessdate=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dalrymple|first=Jim|title=New Apple software lets Intel Macs boot Windows|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/50204/2006/04/bootcamp.html|publisher=Macworld|accessdate=May 14, 2010|date=March 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2006, Apple's [[industrial design]] has shifted to favor aluminum, which was used in the construction of the first [[MacBook Pro]].  Glass was added in 2008 with the introduction of the unibody MacBook Pro.  These materials are billed as environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/environment/|title=The story behind Apple's environmental footprint.|publisher=Apple|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iMac, MacBook Pro and MacBook Air lines use aluminum enclosures, and are now made of a single [[Monocoque|unibody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/10/14macbook.html|title=New MacBook Family Redefines Notebook Design|date=October 14, 2008|publisher=Apple|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5385841/apple-imac-hands-on|title=Apple iMac Hands On|author=Lam, Brian|work=Gizmodo|date=October 20, 2009|accessdate=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief designer [[Jonathan Ive]] continues to guide products towards a minimalist and simple feel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/culture/design/news/2003/06/59381?currentPage=all|title=Design According to Ive|date=June 25, 2003|first=Leander|last=Kahney|publisher=Wired|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5399420/watch-jonathan-ives-segment-in-objectified|title=Watch Jonathan Ive's Segment in ''Objectified''|first=Dan|last=Nosowitz|date=November 7, 2009|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the elimination of replaceable batteries in notebooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/06/08mbp.html|title=Apple Updates MacBook Pro Family with New Models &amp; Innovative Built-in Battery for Up to 40% Longer Battery Life|date=June 8, 2009|publisher=Apple|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multi-touch]] [[Gesture recognition|gestures]] from the [[iPhone]]'s [[IOS (Apple)|interface]] have been applied to the Mac line in the form of touch pads on notebooks and the [[Magic Mouse]] and [[Magic Trackpad]] for desktops.

In recent years, Apple has seen a significant boost in sales of Macs. This has been attributed, in part, to the success of the [[iPod]] and the [[iPhone]], a [[halo effect]] whereby satisfied iPod or iPhone owners purchase more Apple equipment,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/10/technology/10apple.html Apple Aims for the Masses With a Cheaper iPhone]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the use of Intel microprocessors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506EED81030F935A35757C0A9609C8B63&amp;pagewanted=all Windows or Mac?

On February 24, 2011, Apple was the first company to bring to market a computer that utilized Intel's new Thunderbolt (codename Light Peak) I/O interface. Using the same physical interface as a [[Mini DisplayPort]], and backwards compatible with that standard, Thunderbolt boasts two-way transfer speeds of 10&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Intel Thunderbolt Technology press release&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2011/02/24/thunderbolt-technology-the-fastest-data-connection-to-your-pc-just-arrived | title = Thunderbolt Technology: The Fastest Data Connection to Your PC Just Arrived}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Macintosh hardware}}
Apple directly sub-contracts hardware production to Asian [[original equipment manufacturer]]s such as [[Asus]], maintaining a high degree of control over the end product. By contrast, most other companies (including [[Microsoft]]) create software that can be run on hardware produced by a variety of [[Third-party developer|third-parties]], like [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]/[[Compaq]], and [[Lenovo]]. Consequently, the Macintosh buyer has comparably fewer options.

The current Mac product family uses [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] [[x86-64]] [[Central processing unit|processors]]. Apple introduced an emulator during the transition from [[PowerPC]] chips (called [[Rosetta (binary translation software)|Rosetta]]), much as it did during the transition from [[Motorola 68000]] architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,933453,00.asp|title=Apple Switch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 2&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] [[RAM]] as standard. Current Mac computers use [[Radeon|ATI Radeon]] or [[GeForce|nVidia GeForce]] [[graphics card]]s as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs (except for the [[MacBook Air]] and [[Mac Mini]]) ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner, called the [[SuperDrive]]. Macs include two standard data transfer ports: [[USB 2.0|USB]] and [[FireWire]] (except for the [[MacBook Air]] and [[MacBook]] that do not include FireWire). MacBook Pro, iMac, and MacBook Air computers now also feature the &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second. USB was introduced in the 1998 [[iMac G3]] and is ubiquitous today,&lt;ref name=&quot;eight ways&quot; /&gt; while FireWire is mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras. Starting with a new iMac G5 released in October 2005, Apple started to include built-in [[iSight]] cameras to appropriate models, and a media center interface called [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]] that can be operated by an [[Apple Remote]] or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Apple|date=October 12, 2005|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/oct/12imac.html|title=Apple Introduces the New iMac G5|accessdate=July 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple was initially reluctant to embrace [[mouse (computing)|mice]] with multiple buttons and [[scroll wheel]]s.&lt;!--Source: Implied by next ref--&gt; Macs did not natively support multiple buttons, even from third parties, until Mac OS X arrived in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Wired|date=October 30, 2000|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2000/10/39773|title=Eek!

While it looked like a traditional one-button mouse, it actually had four buttons and a scroll ball, capable of independent ''x''- and ''y''-[[Cartesian coordinate system|axis]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Apple|date=August 2, 2005|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/aug/02mightymouse.html|title=Apple Introduces Mighty Mouse|accessdate=July 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bluetooth version followed in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Apple|date=July 25, 2006|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/jul/25mightymouse.html|title=Apple Debuts Wireless Mighty Mouse|accessdate=November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, Apple introduced the [[Apple Magic Mouse|Magic Mouse]] which uses [[multi-touch]] [[gesture recognition]] similar to the [[iPhone]] instead of a physical scroll wheel or ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magic Mouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/10/20magicmouse.html|title=Apple Introduces Magic Mouse—The World's First Multi-Touch Mouse|date=October 20, 2009|publisher=Apple|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available only in Bluetooth, and the Mighty Mouse (re-branded as &quot;Apple Mouse&quot;) is available with a cord. Apple also features the &quot;Magic Trackpad&quot; as a means to control Macintosh desktop computers such as the iMac or Mac Pro. This was introduced in 2010.

===Software===
{{Main|Mac OS|History of Mac OS|Mac OS X}}
The original Macintosh was the first successful personal computer to use a [[graphical user interface]] devoid of a [[command line]]. It used a [[desktop metaphor]], depicting real-world objects like documents and a trashcan as [[icon (computing)|icons]] onscreen. The ''[[Mac OS history#Release|System]]'' software introduced in 1984 with the first Macintosh and renamed ''[[System 7#Mac OS 7.6|Mac OS]]'' in 1997, continued to evolve until version [[Mac OS 9|9.2.2]]. In 2001, Apple introduced Mac OS X, based on [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] and [[NEXTSTEP]]; its new features included the [[Dock (computing)|Dock]] and the [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]] user interface. During the transition, Apple included an emulator known as [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]] allowing users to run Mac OS 9 applications under Mac OS X, version 10.4 and earlier on PowerPC machines. The most recent version is [[Mac OS X v10.7]] &quot;Lion.&quot; In addition to Lion, all new Macs are bundled with assorted Apple-produced applications, including [[iLife]], the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] [[web browser]] and the [[iTunes]] media player. Apple released Mac OS X 10.7 in 2010, which was made available in the summer of 2011. This operating system includes many new features such as: Mission Control, the Mac App Store (available to [[Mac OS X v10.6.6]] &quot;Snow Leopard.&quot; users by software update),Launchpad, an application viewer and launcher akin to the iOS Home Screen, and Resume, a feature similar to the hibernate function found in Microsoft Windows.  

Historically Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence of the types of [[malware]] and [[spyware]] that affect [[Microsoft Windows]] users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196800670&amp;pgno=4 |first=John|last=Welch|title=Review: Mac OS X Shines In Comparison With Windows Vista|publisher=Information Week|date=January 6, 2007|accessdate=February 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/10/06/linux_vs_windows_viruses/|first=Scott|last=Granneman|title=Linux vs. Windows Viruses|publisher=The Register|date=October 6, 2003|accessdate=February 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gruber|first=John|authorlink=John Gruber|date=June 4, 2004|url=http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/broken_windows|title=Broken Windows|publisher=[[Daring Fireball]]|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mac OS X has a smaller [[usage share of operating systems|usage share]] compared to Microsoft Windows (roughly 5% and 92%, respectively),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=8|title=Operating System Market Share|accessdate=April 10, 2009|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it also has secure [[UNIX]] roots. Worms as well as potential vulnerabilities were noted in February 2006, that led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X is not immune to malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1929342,00.asp|title=New Safari Flaw, Worms Turn Spotlight on Apple Security|publisher=[[eWeek]]|author=Roberts, Paul|date=February 21, 2006|accessdate=November 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betanews.com/article/Macs-dont-get-viruses-myth-dissolves-before-publics-eyes/1251493625 |title='Macs don't get viruses' myth dissolves before public's eyes|first= Tim |last=Conneally |date=August 28, 2009 |publisher=BetaNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple releases security updates for its software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple security updates|publisher=Apple|date=January 21, 2009|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222|accessdate=January 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011 Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grimes |first=Roger A. |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/security/7-questions-about-the-mac-malware-scare-811 |title=7 questions about the Mac malware scare &amp;#124; Security |publisher=InfoWorld |date=May 23, 2011 |accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and malware such as [[Mac Defender]], MacProtector, MacGuard were seen as an increasing problem for Mac users.

Originally, the hardware architecture was so closely tied to the Mac OS operating system that it was impossible to boot an alternative operating system. The most common workaround, used even by Apple for [[A/UX]], was to boot into Mac OS and then to hand over control to a program that took over the system and acted as a boot loader. This technique was no longer necessary with the introduction of Open Firmware-based PCI Macs, though it was formerly used for convenience on many [[Old World ROM]] systems due to bugs in the firmware implementation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Now, Mac hardware boots directly from [[Open Firmware]] (most PowerPC-based Macs) or [[Extensible Firmware Interface|EFI]] (all Intel-based Macs), and Macs are no longer limited to running just Mac OS X.

Following the release of the Intel-based Mac, third-party [[platform virtualization]] software such as [[Parallels Desktop]], [[VMware Fusion]], and [[VirtualBox]] began to emerge. These programs allow users to run [[Microsoft Windows]] or previously Windows-only software on Macs at near native speed. Apple also released [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] and Mac-specific Windows [[Device driver|drivers]] that help users to install [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista|Vista]] and natively [[dual boot]] between Mac OS X and Windows. Though not condoned by Apple, it is possible to run the [[Linux]] operating system using Boot camp or other virtualization [[workaround]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul J. Lucas's Mac Mini running Linux|first=Paul|last=Lucas|url=http://homepage.mac.com/pauljlucas/personal/macmini/index.html|date=June 4, 2005|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtualization Makes Running Linux a Snap|first=Lisa|last=Hoover|url=http://ostatic.com/blog/virtualization-makes-running-linux-a-snap|date=April 11, 2008|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Mac OS X is a [[UNIX]] system, borrowing heavily from [[FreeBSD]], many applications written for [[Linux kernel|Linux]]&lt;!--do not fix--&gt; or [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] run on Mac OS X, often using [[X Window System|X11]]. Apple's smaller market share than Microsoft's means that a smaller range of [[shareware]] is available, but many popular [[commercial software]] applications from large developers such as [[Microsoft Office]] and [[Adobe Photoshop]] are ported to both Mac OS and Windows. And much of [[open source software]] like the [[Firefox]] [[web browser]] and the [[OpenOffice.org]] [[office suite]] are [[cross-platform]] and run natively.

==Advertising==
{{Main|Apple Inc. advertising}}
Macintosh advertisements have usually attacked the established market leader, directly or indirectly. They tend to portray the Mac as an alternative to overly complex or unreliable PCs. Apple hyped the introduction of the original Mac with their [[1984 (television commercial)|1984]] commercial that aired during the [[Super Bowl XVIII|Super Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Pogue| first = David| coauthors = Joseph Schorr| title = Macworld Macintosh SECRETS| publisher=IDG Books Worldwide, Inc.| location = San Mateo| year = 1993| isbn = 1-56884-025-X| page = 251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was supplemented by a number of printed pamphlets and other TV ads demonstrating the new interface and emphasizing the mouse. Many more brochures for new models like the [[Macintosh Plus]] and the [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]] followed. In the 1990s, Apple started the &quot;What's on your PowerBook?&quot; campaign, with print ads and television commercials featuring celebrities describing how the PowerBook helps them in their businesses and everyday lives. In 1995, Apple responded to the introduction of [[Windows 95]] with several print ads and a television commercial demonstrating its disadvantages and lack of innovation. In 1997 the [[Think Different]] campaign introduced Apple's new slogan, and in 2002 the [[Apple Switch ad campaign|Switch campaign]] followed. The most recent advertising strategy by Apple is the [[Get a Mac]] campaign, with North American, UK and Japanese variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/uk/getamac/|title=Get a Mac advertisements|publisher=Apple|accessdate=January 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/jp/getamac/|title=Get a Mac|publisher=Apple|accessdate=February 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Apple introduces new products at &quot;special events&quot; at the Apple Town Hall auditorium, and [[Stevenote|keynotes]] at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]], and (formerly) [[trade shows]] like the [[Apple Expo]] and the [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|MacWorld Expo]]. The events typically draw a large gathering of media representatives and spectators, and are preceded by [[Apple rumor community|speculation]] about possible new products. In the past, special events have been used to unveil its desktop and notebook computers such as the iMac and MacBook, and other consumer electronic devices like the [[iPod]], [[Apple TV]], and [[iPhone]], as well as provide updates on sales and market share statistics. Apple has begun to focus its advertising on its [[Apple store|retail stores]] instead of these trade shows; the last MacWorld keynote was in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last year at Macworld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/12/16macworld.html|title=Apple Announces Its Last Year at Macworld|date=December 16, 2008|publisher=Apple|accessdate=March 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market share and user demographics==
Since the introduction of the Macintosh, Apple has struggled to gain a significant [[market share|share]] of the personal computer market. At first, the Macintosh 128K suffered from a dearth of available software compared to IBM's PC, resulting in disappointing sales in 1984 and 1985. It took 74&amp;nbsp;days for 50,000&amp;nbsp;units to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Polsson|first=Ken|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm|title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers|date=July 29, 2009|accessdate=August 27, 2009}} See April 7, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Market share is measured by browser hits, sales and installed base.

By March 2011, OS X market share in North America had increased to slightly over 14%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://9to5mac.com/2011/03/17/top-10-mac-countries-by-market-share-united-states-is-3/]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid 1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gruber|first=John|authorlink=John Gruber|date=July 23, 2003|url=http://daringfireball.net/2003/07/market_share|title=Market Share|publisher=[[Daring Fireball]]|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brockmeier|first=Joe|date=May 13, 2003|url=http://www.newsfactor.com/perl/story/21499.html|title=What Will It Take To Put Apple Back on Top?|publisher=NewsFactor Magazine online|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/2010/10/21/1390638/despite-growing-sales-macs-share.html|title=Despite growing sales, Mac's share of Apple profits wanes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Toporek|first=Chuck|date=August 22, 2001 |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2001/08/apple_market_share_and_who_car.html|title=Apple, Market Share, and Who Cares?|publisher=O'Reilly macdevcenter.com|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spero|first=Ricky|date=July 14, 2004|url=http://www.macobserver.com/stockwatch/2004/07/14.1.shtml|title=Apple Posts Profit of $61&amp;nbsp;million; Revenue Jumps 30%|publisher=The Mac Observer|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, a report published in the first quarter of 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, including 66% of all computers over $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilcox|first=Joe|url=http://blogs.eweek.com/applewatch/content/channel/macs_defy_windows-gravity.html|title=Macs Defy Windows' Gravity|publisher=Apple Watch|accessdate=May 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Market research]] indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fried|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Fried (writer)|date=July 12, 2002|url=http://news.com.com/2100-1040-943519.html|title=Are Mac users smarter?|publisher=[[news.com]]|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''iPhone''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|aɪ|f|oʊ|n}} {{respell|EYE|fohn}}) is a line of Internet- and [[multimedia]]-enabled [[smartphone]]s marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] The [[iPhone (original)|first iPhone]] was unveiled by [[Steve Jobs]], then [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Apple, on January 9, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/54769/2007/01/iphone.html |title=Apple unveils iPhone |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=April 6, 2008 |author=Honan, Mathew |work=[[Macworld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released on June 29, 2007. The 5th generation iPhone, the [[iPhone 4S]], was announced on October 4, 2011, and released 10 days later.

An iPhone can function as a [[video camera]] (video recording was not a standard feature until the [[iPhone 3GS]] was released), a [[camera phone]], a [[portable media player]], and an Internet client with email and [[web browser|web browsing]] capabilities, can send [[text messaging|texts]] and receive [[visual voicemail]], and has both [[Wi-Fi]] and [[3G]] connectivity. The [[user interface]] is built around the device's [[multi-touch]] screen, including a [[virtual keyboard]] rather than a physical one. 

Third-party as well as Apple [[application software]] is available from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], which launched in mid-2008 and now has over 500,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Apple Inc. |url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/ios4/ |title=iPhone – Learn about apps available on the App Store |publisher=Apple |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;apps&quot; approved by Apple. These apps have diverse functions, including [[Video game|games]], [[reference work|reference]], [[GPS navigation software|GPS navigation]], [[Social network service|social networking]], security and advertising for television shows, films, and [[Celebrity|celebrities]].

There are five [[List of iOS devices#iPhone|generations]] of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the five major releases of [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] (formerly iPhone OS). The [[iPhone (original)|original iPhone]] was a [[GSM]] phone, and established design precedents, such as screen size and button placement, that have persisted through all models. The [[iPhone 3G]] added [[3G]] cellular network capabilities and [[A-GPS]] [[W3C Geolocation API|location]]. The [[iPhone 3GS]] added a compass, faster [[Central processing unit|processor]], and higher resolution camera, including video recording at [[480p]]. 

The [[iPhone 4]] has a rear-facing camera ([[720p]] video) and a front facing camera (at a lower resolution) for [[FaceTime]] video calling and for use in other apps like [[Skype]]. The iPhone 4 featured a higher-resolution 960x640 display; it was released on June 24, 2010. In the U.S., [[AT&amp;T]] was the only authorized carrier until February 10, 2011, when a [[CDMA2000|CDMA]] version of the iPhone 4 launched for [[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]]. On October 4, 2011, Apple announced the [[iPhone 4S]].&lt;ref&gt;iPhone 4S launched by Apple http://www.skoolboyz.in/2011/10/iphone-4s-next-iphone-launched-in-lets.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[iPhone 4S]] added a higher resolution camera (8 [[megapixel]]) with [[1080p]] video recording, [[face detection]], and [[Image stabilization|video stabilization]], a faster, dual core processor, support for both GSM/UMTS and CDMA on one chip, [[GLONASS]] support and a [[Natural language processing|natural language]] [[voice control]] system called [[Siri (software)|Siri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/iphone/compare-iphones/ iPhone – Compare]. Apple. Retrieved on 2011-11-06.&lt;/ref&gt; It is available in 16 GB and 32 GB, as well as a new 64 GB capacity. In the United States, it was announced that two new carriers, [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] and [[C Spire Wireless|C Spire]], would begin carrying the [[iPhone 4]] and [[iPhone 4S]] in October and November 2011, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;cspire&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/10/19/technology/cspire_iphone/ |title=Tiny regional carrier C Spire lands iPhone 4S |author=David Goldman |date=October 19, 2011 |work=CNN |accessdate=18 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the iPhone began in 2005 with Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]]' direction that Apple engineers investigate touchscreens.&lt;ref name=&quot;keynoteMacworld&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Peter|url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/01/09/liveupdate/index.php|title=Macworld Expo Keynote Live Update|work=Macworld|date=January 9, 2007|accessdate=February 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also steered the original focus away from a tablet, like the [[iPad]], and towards a phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murtazin|first=Eldar|url=http://mobile-review.com/articles/2010/iphone-history3-en.shtml|title=Apple's Phone: From 1980s' Sketches to iPhone.

Apple rejected the &quot;[[design by committee]]&quot; approach that had yielded the [[Motorola ROKR E1]], a largely unsuccessful&lt;ref&gt;[http://iphone5buzz.org/2011/11/before-the-iphone-there-was-the-rokr/ Before the iPhone there was ROKR][http://iphone5buzz.org iphone5 buzz], Retrieved November 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; collaboration with [[Motorola]].

Jobs unveiled the iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007 at the [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|Macworld]] 2007 convention at the [[Moscone Center]] in San Francisco. The iPhone went on sale in the United States on June 29, 2007, at 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm local time, while hundreds of customers lined up outside the stores nationwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;AppleQ32007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/q307data_sum.pdf|title=Apple Inc.

On July 11, 2008, Apple released the iPhone 3G in twenty-two countries, including the original six.&lt;ref name=&quot;iPhone 3G launch countries&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipod.about.com/od/iphone3g/a/iphone_3g_rel.htm|title=Initial iPhone 3G Country Availability List|last=Costello|first=Sam|publisher=about.com|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple released the iPhone 3G in upwards of eighty countries and territories.&lt;!--A precise number would be great!--&gt;&lt;ref name=3G_countries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/countries/|title=iPhone 3G Coming to countries everywhere|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|accessdate=April 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple announced the iPhone 3GS on June 8, 2009, along with plans to release it later in June, July, and August, starting with the U.S., Canada and major European countries on June 19. Many would-be users objected to the iPhone's cost,&lt;ref name=&quot;NPD demographics&quot;/&gt; and 40% of users have household incomes over US$100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen demographics&quot; /&gt; 

In an attempt to gain a wider market, Apple retained the 8&amp;nbsp;GB iPhone 3G at a lower price point. When Apple introduced the iPhone 4, the 3GS became the less expensive model. Apple reduced the price several times since the iPhone's release in 2007, at which time an 8&amp;nbsp;GB iPhone sold for $599. An iPhone 3GS with the same capacity now has no cost to the customer, as of the release of the iPhone 4S. However, these numbers are misleading, since all iPhone units sold through AT&amp;T require a two-year contract (costing several thousand dollars and including an early termination fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Broache|first=Anne|title=Democrats criticize AT&amp;T's exclusive iPhone deal|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9742441-7.html{{!}}title=Democrats|publisher=cnet news|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and a [[#SIM unlocking|SIM lock]].

==Hardware==
===Screen and input===
The [[touchscreen]] is a 9&amp;nbsp;cm (3.5&amp;nbsp;in) [[liquid crystal display]] with scratch-resistant glass.&lt;ref name=jun18PressRelease&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=June 18, 2007|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/18iphone.html|title=iPhone Delivers Up to Eight Hours of Talk Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[capacitive touchscreen]] is designed for a bare finger, or multiple fingers for [[multi-touch]] sensing. The screens on the first three generations have a resolution of 320 × 480 ([[HVGA]]) at 163 [[pixel density|ppi]], while that of [[iPhone 4]] and [[iPhone 4S]] has a resolution of 640 × 960 at 326 ppi.

The touch and gesture features of the iPhone are based on technology originally developed by [[FingerWorks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iGesture Game Mode Guide|last=Fingerworks, Inc.|year=2003|publisher=www.fingerworks.com|url=http://rwservices.no-ip.info:81/pens/biblio05.html#Fingerworks03|accessdate=April 30, 2009|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most gloves and [[Stylus (computing)|styluses]] prevent the necessary electrical conductivity;&lt;ref name=HowiPhoneWorks&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Tracy|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/iphone.htm|title=How the iPhone Works|publisher=[[How Stuff Works]]|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pogueFAQ&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=David Pogue|last=Pogue|first=David|url=http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/01/11/the-ultimate-iphone-frequently-asked-questions/|title=The Ultimate iPhone Frequently Asked Questions|work=The New York Times |date=January 11, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pogueFAQ2&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=David Pogue|last=Pogue|first=David|url=http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/01/13/ultimate-iphone-faqs-list-part-2/|title=Ultimate iPhone FAQs list, Part 2|work=The New York Times |date=January 13, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/iphone2.htm|title=How the iPhone's touchscreen Works|publisher=[[How Stuff Works]]|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, [[Capacitive stylus|capacitive styli]] can be used with iPhone's finger-touch screen.

From left to right, sides: wake/sleep button, SIM card slot, headphone jack, silence switch, volume controls. The switches were black plastic on the original iPhone. Top: earpiece, screen.]]

The iPhone has a minimal hardware user interface, featuring only four or five [[Push-button|buttons]], depending on the generation. The only physical menu button is situated directly below the display, and is called the &quot;Home button&quot; because it closes the active app and navigates to the home screen of the interface. The home button is denoted not by a house, as on many other similar devices, but a [[Squircle|rounded square]], reminiscent of the shape of icons on the home screen. 

A multifunction sleep/wake button is located on the top of the device. It serves as the unit's power button, and also controls [[#Phone|phone calls]]. When a call is received, pressing the sleep/wake button once silences the ringtone, and when pressed twice transfers the call to voicemail. Situated on the left spine are the volume adjustment controls. The iPhone 4 has two separate circular buttons to increase and decrease the volume; all earlier models house two switches under a single plastic panel, known as a rocker switch, which could reasonably be counted as either one or two buttons. 

Directly above the volume controls is a ring/silent switch that when engaged mutes telephone ringing, alert sounds from new &amp; sent emails, text messages, and other push notifications, camera shutter sounds, Voice Memo sound effects, phone lock/unlock sounds, keyboard clicks, and spoken autocorrections. This switch does not mute alarm sounds from the Clock application, and in some countries or regions it will not mute the camera shutter or Voice Memo sound effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iphone_user_guide.pdf manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iphone_user_guide.pdf]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-11-06.&lt;/ref&gt; All buttons except Home were made of plastic on the original iPhone and metal on all later models. The touchscreen furnishes the remainder of the [[#Interface|user interface]].

The display responds to three sensors (four on the iPhone 4). A [[proximity sensor]] deactivates the display and [[touchscreen]] when the device is brought near the face during a call. This is done to save battery power and to prevent inadvertent inputs from the user's face and ears. An ambient light sensor adjusts the display brightness which in turn saves battery power. A 3-axis [[accelerometer]] senses the orientation of the phone and changes the screen accordingly, allowing the user to easily switch between [[page orientation|portrait and landscape]] mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=R.

Unlike the [[iPad]], the iPhone does not rotate the screen when turned upside-down, with the Home button above the screen, unless the running program has been specifically designed to do so. The 3.0 update added landscape support for still other applications, such as email, and introduced shaking the unit as a form of input.&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 official&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 Macworld&quot; /&gt; The accelerometer can also be used to control [[#Third-party applications|third-party apps]], notably games. The iPhone 4 also includes a [[Vibrating structure gyroscope|gyroscopic sensor]], enhancing its perception of how it is moved.

A software update in January 2008&lt;ref name=&quot;Update 1.1.3&quot;/&gt; allowed the first-generation iPhone to use cell tower and Wi-Fi network locations [[trilateration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardforums.com/printthread.php?t=1383413 |title=Memo: iPhone does not use triangulation|last=XFF [[List of Latin phrases: E|et al.]]|date=June 13, 2008|publisher=HowardForums|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite lacking [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] hardware. The iPhone 3G, 3GS and 4 employ [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]], and the iPhone 3GS and 4 also have a [[digital compass]].&lt;ref name=Compass/&gt; iPhone 4S supports [[GLONASS]] global positioning system in addition to GPS.

===Audio and output===
[[File:IPhone-bottom.jpg|thumb|One of two speakers (left) and the microphone (right) surround the [[dock connector]] on the base of the original iPhone. If a headset is plugged in, sound is played through it instead.]]

On the bottom of the iPhone there is a speaker to the left of the dock connector and a microphone to the right. There is an additional loudspeaker above the screen that serves as an earpiece during phone calls. The iPhone 4 includes an additional microphone at the top of the unit for [[Noise-canceling microphone|noise cancellation]], and switches the placement of the microphone and speaker on the base on the unit—the speaker is on the right.&lt;ref name=&quot;4_tech_specs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;– iPhone 4&amp;nbsp;– Size, weight, battery life, and other specs|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=July 1, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5quBTT6io|archivedate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume controls are located on the left side of all iPhone models and as a slider in the iPod application.

The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[TRRS connector]]&lt;!--Not a typo, two Rs--&gt; for the headphones is located on the top left corner of the device.&lt;ref name=&quot;TRRS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Tip+and+ring|title=tip and ring|work=Computer Desktop Encyclopedia|publisher=The Computer Language Company Inc.|accessdate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headphone socket on the original iPhone is recessed into the casing, making it incompatible with most headsets without the use of an adapter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Original Cnet review&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/Apple/?p=828|title=That ****ed recessed iPhone headphone jack|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent generations eliminated the issue by using a flush-mounted headphone socket. Cars equipped with an [[Jack (connector)|auxiliary jack]] allow for handsfree use of the iPhone while driving as a substitute for [[Bluetooth]].

While the iPhone is compatible with normal headphones, Apple provides a [[Headset (telephone/computer)|headset]] with additional functionality. A multipurpose button near the microphone can be used to play or pause music, skip tracks, and answer or end phone calls without touching the iPhone. A small number of third-party headsets specifically designed for the iPhone also include the microphone and control button.&lt;ref name=&quot;Review: iPhone headsets&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/133445/2008/05/iphoneheadsets.html|title=Review: iPhone headsets|last=Frakes|first=Dan|date=May 14, 2008|work=Macworld|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current headsets also provide volume controls, which are only compatible with more recent models.&lt;!--3GS &amp; 4--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Earbuds with volume&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB770G/B?fnode=MTY1NDA1MA&amp;mco=MTM3NTI1ODk|title=Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic|publisher=Apple Store|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features are achieved by a fourth ring in the audio jack that carries this extra information.

The built-in [[Enhanced Data Rate|Bluetooth 2.x+EDR]] supports wireless earpieces and headphones, which requires the [[Bluetooth profile#Headset Profile (HSP)|HSP]] [[Bluetooth profile|profile]]. Stereo audio was added in the 3.0 update for hardware that supports [[A2DP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 official&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 Macworld&quot; /&gt; While non-sanctioned third-party solutions exist, the iPhone does not officially support the [[OBEX]] [[Bluetooth protocols#Object exchange (OBEX)|file transfer]] [[Bluetooth protocols|protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/01/ibluetooth-team-achieves-obex-file-transfer.ars|title=iBluetooth team achieves OBEX file transfer|last=Sadun|first=Erica|date=January 26, 2009|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of these profiles prevents iPhone users from exchanging multimedia files, such as pictures, music and videos, with other bluetooth-enabled cell phones.

Alternatively, a USB to AC adapter (or &quot;wall charger,&quot; also included) can be connected to the cable to charge directly from an [[AC power plugs and sockets|AC outlet]]. A number of third-party accessories (car chargers, portable chargers, battery cases, stereo dock chargers, and even [[Solar power|solar]] chargers) are also available.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Apple runs tests on preproduction units to determine battery life.

If the battery malfunctions or dies prematurely, the phone can be returned to Apple and replaced for free while still under [[warranty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/service/faq/|title=iPhone Service Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warranty lasts one year from purchase and can be extended to two years with [[AppleCare]]. The battery replacement service and its pricing was not made known to buyers until the day the product was launched,&lt;ref name=LeeEllen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wong|first=May|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/08/AR2007070800562_pf.html|title=Apple Issues Battery Program for IPhone|work=The Washington Post|date=July 8, 2007|accessdate=July 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is similar to how Apple (and third parties) replace batteries for iPods. The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a [[consumer protection|consumer advocate]] group, has sent a complaint to Apple and [[AT&amp;T]] over the fee that consumers have to pay to have the battery replaced.&lt;ref name=LeeEllen&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Ellen|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/07/11/BUG34QU3921.DTL |title=Will a Cheaper iPhone click before Christmas?|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 11, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since July 2007, third-party battery replacement kits have been available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/31/iphones-first-sketchy-battery-replacement-kit-appears/|title=iPhone's first sketchy battery replacement kit appears|work=[[Engadget]]|date=July 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a much lower price than Apple's own battery replacement program. These kits often include a small screwdriver and an instruction leaflet, but as with many newer iPod models the battery in the original iPhone has been [[solder]]ed in. Therefore a soldering iron is required to install the new battery. The iPhone 3G uses a different battery fitted with a connector that is easier to replace.&lt;ref name=&quot;3G quasi-replaceable battery&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5023983/the-iphone-3g-battery-is-quasi+replaceable|title=The iPhone 3G Battery Is Quasi-Replaceable|last=Wilson|first=Mark|date=July 10, 2008|work=Gizmodo|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:iPhone 4 cameras.png|thumb|The iPhone 4 is the first generation to have two cameras. The [[LED]] [[flash (photography)|flash]] for the rear-facing camera (top) and the forward-facing camera (bottom) are both unique to that model.]]

===Camera===
The original iPhone and iPhone 3G feature a built-in [[Fixed focus]] 2.0&amp;nbsp;[[megapixel]] camera located on the back for still digital photos. It has no optical zoom, flash or [[autofocus]], and does not support video recording (iPhone 3G does support video recording via third-party App available on the App Store), however [[#Third-party applications|jailbreaking]] allows users to do so. Version 2.0 of iPhone OS introduced the capability to [[geotagging|embed location data]] in the pictures, producing [[geocoded photograph]]s.

The iPhone 3GS has a 3.2&amp;nbsp;megapixel camera, manufactured by [[OmniVision Technologies|OmniVision]], featuring autofocus, auto white balance, and auto macro (up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm). It is also capable of capturing 640x480 ([[Display resolution|VGA]] resolution) video at 30 frames per second,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/au/iphone/iphone3gs-specs.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;— iPhone 3Gs&amp;nbsp;— Technical Specifications|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=June 21, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; although compared to higher-end [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] based video cameras it does exhibit the [[rolling shutter]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handheldhollywood.com/latest-news/foundrys-rollingshutter-can-fix-iphone-jellocam.html|title=Foundry's RollingShutter can Fix iPhone Jellocam|date=November 16, 2009|publisher=Hand Held Hollywood|accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video can then be [[video editing|cropped]] on the device itself and directly uploaded to YouTube, [[MobileMe]], or other services.

The iPhone 4 introduced a 5.0&amp;nbsp;[[megapixel]] camera (2592x1936 pixels), also located on the back, which is equipped with a [[Backside illumination|backside illuminated]] sensor capable of capturing pictures in low-light conditions, as well as an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] [[Flash (photography)|flash]] capable of staying lit for video recording at [[720p]] resolution, considered [[High-definition video|high-definition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/au/iphone/specs.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;— iPhone 4&amp;nbsp;— Technical Specifications|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
iPhone 4 is the first iPhone that has the [[High dynamic range imaging|high dynamic range photography]] feature.&lt;ref name=&quot;at2011-06-19&quot;&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/09/hdr-photography-with-iphone-4-and-ios-41.ars HDR photography with iPhone 4 and iOS 4.1: how good is it?], Chris Foresman, September 13, 2010, Ars Technica, retrieved at June 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition the iPhone 4 has a second camera on the front capable of [[Display resolution|VGA]] photos and [[Standard-definition television|SD]] video recording.

Regardless of the source, saved recordings may be synced to the host computer, attached to email, or (where supported) sent by [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]]. Videos may be uploaded to YouTube directly.

The camera on the iPhone 4S is capable of shooting 8MP stills and recording 1080p videos. The camera can now be accessed directly from the lock screen, and the volume up button as a shutter trigger. The built-in gyroscope is able to stabilize the camera while recording video.

Beta code pulled from iOS 5 suggests that the next feature to be released will allow users to capture a panoramic photo on their iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Lowensohn, CNET. &quot;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-27076_3-20079537-248/more-signs-of-an-iphone-panorama-tool-emerge/ More signs of an iPhone panorama tool emerge].&quot; July 14, 2011. Retrieved July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On all five model generations, the phone can be configured to bring up the camera app by quickly pressing the home key twice.&lt;ref name=derspiegel&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/gadgets/0,1518,789946,00.html Neues iPhone 4S, by Der Speigel, 05.10.2011] ([http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/gadgets/0,1518,789946,00.html&amp;ei=1VOPTsPBBsO3twftxLyEDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ7gEwAA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dder%2Bspiegel%2Biphone%2B4s%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG%26biw%3D1024%26bih%3D627%26prmd%3Dimvns Translation by Google])&lt;/ref&gt; On all iPhones running [[iOS version history#iOS 5.x: Fifth major OS release|iOS 5]] it can also be accessed from the lock screen directly.

===Storage and SIM===
[[File:Iphonesimcard.JPG|thumb|An iPhone 3G with the SIM slot open. The SIM ejector tool is still placed in the eject hole.]]

The iPhone was initially released with two options for internal storage size: 4&amp;nbsp;GB or 8&amp;nbsp;GB. On September 5, 2007, Apple discontinued the 4&amp;nbsp;GB models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iphoneatlas.com/2007/09/05/apple-kills-4gb-iphone-cuts-8gb-price-to-399/|title=Apple kills 4&amp;nbsp;GB iPhone, cuts 8&amp;nbsp;GB price to $399&amp;nbsp;– iPhone Atlas|date=September 5, 2007|publisher=iPhone Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 5, 2008, Apple added a 16&amp;nbsp;GB model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/131959/2008/02/iphoneipodtouch.html|work=[[Macworld]]|title=Apple offers 16&amp;nbsp;GB iPhone, 32&amp;nbsp;GB iPod touch|date=February 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone 3G was available in 16&amp;nbsp;GB and 8&amp;nbsp;GB. The iPhone 3GS came in 16&amp;nbsp;GB and 32&amp;nbsp;GB variants and still is available in 8&amp;nbsp;GB. 

The iPhone 4 is available in 16&amp;nbsp;GB and 32&amp;nbsp;GB variants, as well as a newly introduced 8 GB variant to be sold along side the iPhone 4S at a reduced price point. The iPhone 4S is available in three sizes: 16&amp;nbsp;GB, 32&amp;nbsp;GB and 64&amp;nbsp;GB.  All data is stored on the internal flash drive; the iPhone does not support expanded storage through a memory card slot, or the SIM card.

[[GSM]] Models of the iPhone use a [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] to identify themselves to the GSM network. The SIM sits in a tray, which is inserted into a slot at the top of the device. The SIM tray can be ejected with a paperclip or the &quot;SIM ejector tool&quot; (a simple piece of die-cut sheet metal) included with the iPhone 3G and 3GS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1438|title=Removing SIM card|publisher=Apple Inc|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Diaz|first=Jesus|title=iPhone 3G's New SIM Ejector Tool Makes It Instant Must-Buy|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|work=[[Gizmodo]]|date=June 9, 2008|url=http://gizmodo.com/5014767/iphone-3gs-new-sim-ejector-tool-makes-it-instant-must+buy|accessdate=June 24, 2008}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some iPhone models shipped with a SIM ejector tool which was fabricated from an alloy dubbed &quot;[[Liquidmetal]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[GSM]] iPhone 4 features a [[MicroSIM]] card that is located in a slot on the right side of the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Apple Inc. |url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html |title=iPhone 4&amp;nbsp;– Size, weight, battery life, and other specs |publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[CDMA]] model of the iPhone, like all CDMA phones, does not use a SIM.

===Liquid contact indicators===
The iPhone is equipped with liquid contact indicators which change from white to red in color when they come in contact with water. These suggest whether water damage has affected the device. The indicators on the iPhone include a small disc which is located at the bottom of the headphone [[jack (connector)|jack]] and with the iPhone 3G and all later models an additional one is located at the bottom of the [[dock connector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iPhone and iPod: Liquid damage is not covered by warranty|work=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=August 27, 2010|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3302?viewlocale=en_US|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The indicators are often used by Apple employees to determine whether the device [[AppleCare|qualifies]] for a warranty repair or replacement. If the indicators show that the device was exposed to water, they may determine that the device is not covered by Apple. However, the liquid contact indicators may be triggered through routine use, and if a device is worn while exercising, the sweat from an owner may dampen the indicators enough to indicate water damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Martin|title=Sweaty workouts killing iPhones?|publisher=[[Cnet]]|date=April 8, 2009|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10214153-233.html|accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On many other mobile phones from different manufacturers, the liquid contact indicators are located in a protected location, such as beneath the battery behind a battery cover, but the indicators on an iPhone are directly exposed to the environment. This has led to criticism of the placement of the indicators, which may also be affected by steam in a bathroom or other light environmental moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lisa Respers|title=Moisture, cold irritate some smart phone users|publisher=CNN|date=April 14, 2009|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/04/14/smart.phones.buggy/index.html|accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these criticisms, Apple made a silent change to their water damage policy for iPhones and similar products. This new policy allows the customer to request further internal inspection of the phone to verify if internal liquid damage sensors were triggered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgr.com/2010/11/09/apple-amends-internal-ipod-water-damage-policy/|title=Apple Amends Internal iPod Water Damage Policy|last=Epstein|first=Zach|date=November 9, 2010|work=Boy Genius Report|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IPhone 4 box no lid.JPG|thumb|The contents of the box of an iPhone 4. From left to right: iPhone 4 in plastic holder, written documentation, and (top to bottom) headset, USB cable, wall charger.]]
All [[iPhone models]] include written documentation, and a [[dock connector]] to [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] cable. The original and 3G iPhones also came with a cleaning cloth. The original iPhone included stereo [[Headset (telephone/computer)|headset]] ([[headphones|earbuds]] and a microphone) and a plastic dock to hold the unit upright while charging and syncing. The iPhone 3G includes a similar headset plus a SIM eject tool (the original model requires a paperclip). The iPhone 3GS includes the SIM eject tool and a revised headset, which adds volume buttons (not functional with previous iPhone versions).&lt;ref name=&quot;Earbuds with volume&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MB770G/B?fnode=MTY1NDA1MA&amp;mco=MTM3NTMyNDQ|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;Earphones&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;Remote&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Mic|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
{{Main|iOS (Apple)|iOS version history}}
[[File:IOS43GS.PNG|thumb|upright|The default Home screen of iOS 4.2.1 shows most of the applications provided by Apple. Users can download additional applications from the App store, create Web Clips, rearrange the icons, and create and delete folders.]]
The iPhone, [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPad]] run an [[operating system]] known as [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] (formerly iPhone OS). It is a variant of the same [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] operating system core that is found in [[Mac OS X]]. Also included is the &quot;[[Core Animation]]&quot; software component from [[Mac OS X v10.5]] Leopard. Together with the [[PowerVR]] hardware (and on the iPhone 3GS, [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0), it is responsible for the interface's [[motion graphics]]. The operating system takes up less than half a [[gigabyte]].&lt;ref name=VersatileFlash&gt;{{cite web|last=Haslam|first=Karen|url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=16927|title=Macworld Expo: Optimised OS X sits on 'versatile' flash|work=Macworld|date=January 12, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is capable of supporting bundled and future applications from Apple, as well as from third-party developers. Software applications cannot be copied directly from Mac OS X but must be written and compiled specifically for iOS.

Like the iPod, the iPhone is managed from a computer using [[iTunes]]. The earliest versions of the OS required [[iTunes version history|version 7.3 or later]], which is compatible with Mac OS X version 10.3.9 Panther or later, and 32-bit [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista|Vista]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305703|title=iPhone: Minimum system requirements|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of iTunes 7.6 expanded this support to include 64-bit versions of XP and Vista,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple's iTunes 7.6 plays nice with 64 bit Vista|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/15/apples-itunes-7-6-plays-nice-with-64-bit-vista/|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=January 15, 2008|accessdate=January 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a workaround has been discovered for previous 64-bit Windows operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetamd64.com/index.php?showtopic=35132&amp;st=0&amp;p=327771&amp;#entry327771|title=iTunes is now 64-bit|publisher=PlanetAMD64}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Apple provides free updates to the OS for the iPhone through iTunes,&lt;ref name=VersatileFlash/&gt; and major updates have historically accompanied new models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworldcanada.ca/news/feature/to-upgrade-or-not-the-iphone-3g-s-dilemma/130d25f1c0a8000600b4bb6582434a58/pg001.htm|title=To Upgrade or Not: the iPhone 3G S Dilemma|work=Macworld Canada|date=June 24, 2009|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such updates often require a newer version of iTunes&amp;nbsp;— for example, the 3.0 update requires iTunes 8.2&amp;nbsp;— but the iTunes system requirements have stayed the same. Updates include both security patches and new features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kharif|first=Olga|url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2007/07/coming_soon_iph.html|title=Coming Soon: iPhone Software Updates|work=BusinessWeek  |date=July 10, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, iPhone 3G users initially experienced dropped calls until an update was issued.&lt;ref name=&quot;2.1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/135515/2008/09/iphone21.html|title=Apple releases iPhone 2.1 update|last=Cohen|first=Peter|date=September 12, 2008|work=Macworld|accessdate=June 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macblogz.com/2008/08/12/iphone-3g-connection-issues-caused-by-immature-chipset/|title=iPhone 3G Connection Issues Caused by Immature Infineon Chipset?|last=Aviv|date=August 12, 2008|publisher=MacBlogz|accessdate=December 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Version 3.1 required iTunes 9.0, and iOS 4 required iTunes 9.2. iTunes 10.5, which is required to sync and activate iOS 5, the current version of iTunes, Requires Mac OS X 10.5.8 or Leopard on G4 or G5 computers on 800&amp;nbsp;MHz or higher; versions 10.3 and 10.4 and 10.5–10.5.7 are no longer supported.

===Interface===
The [[Graphical user interface|interface]] is based around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. iPhone applications normally run one at a time (not including iOS 4 and iOS 5, which includes running applications in the background),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techie-buzz.com/mobile-news/how-to-multitask-in-ios4-on-iphone-ipod-touch.html |title=How To Multitask in iOS4 on iPhone, iPod Touch |publisher=Techie-buzz.com |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music. The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing the open application in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;home screen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/homescreen.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;— iPhone&amp;nbsp;— Features&amp;nbsp;— Home screen|year=2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By default, the Home screen contains the following icons: Messages ([[Short message service|SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps ([[Google Maps]]), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings, [[iTunes Store|iTunes (store)]], [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], and (on the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4) [[Compass]]. Docked at the base of the screen, four icons for [[Mobile phone|Phone]], [[Email|Mail]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (Internet), and iPod ([[multimedia]]) delineate the iPhone's main purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|title=iPhone Applications|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=July 11, 2007|accessdate=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create &quot;Web Clips&quot;, home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari. After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Update 1.1.3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|title=Apple Enhances Revolutionary iPhone with Software Update|date=January 15, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to sixteen icons, and the dock holds up to four icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, however, may not be removed. The 3.0 update adds a system-wide search, known as [[Spotlight (software)#iOS|Spotlight]], to the left of the first home screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 official&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 Macworld&quot;/&gt;

Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands [[multi-touch gestures|complex gestures using multi-touch]]. The iPhone's [[interaction techniques]] enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as &quot;[[pinching (technology)|pinching]]&quot;. 

Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object. 

Other [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a &quot;back&quot; button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.

===Phone===
[[File:IPhone call screen.png|thumb|upright|When making a call, the iPhone presents a number of options; including [[FaceTime]] on supported models. The screen is [[Proximity sensor|automatically disabled]] when held close to the face.]]
The iPhone allows audio [[conference call|conferencing]], call holding, call merging, [[caller ID]], and integration with other cellular network features and iPhone functions. For example, if music is playing when a call is received, the music fades out, and fades back in when the call has ended. 

The [[proximity sensor]] shuts off the screen and touch-sensitive circuitry when the iPhone is brought close to the face, both to save battery and prevent unintentional touches. The iPhone does not support [[Videophone|video calling]] or [[videoconferencing]] on versions prior to the fourth generation, as there is only one camera on the opposite side of the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/13/mirror-based-video-conferencing-developed-for-iphone/|title=Mirror-based video conferencing developed for iPhone|first=Donald|last=Melanson|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=September 13, 2007|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The iPhone 4 supports video calling using either the front or back camera over Wi-Fi, a feature Apple calls [[FaceTime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/facetime.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;– iPhone 4&amp;nbsp;– One-tap video calling with FaceTime on iPhone 43|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two models only support [[voice command device|voice dialing]] through third-party applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/137421/2008/12/voicedialers.html|title=Review: iPhone voice dialers|last=Tessler|first=Franklin|date=December 12, 2008|work=Macworld|accessdate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voice control, available only on the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, allows users to say a contact's name or number and the iPhone will dial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voice_Control&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-3g-s/voice-control.html|title=iPhone: Make calls and play music using voice control|date=June 10, 2009|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 10, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPhone includes a [[visual voicemail]] (in some countries)&lt;ref name=&quot;VV_abroad&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/iphone-3g-carriers-apple-vary-on-visual-voicemail/|title=iPhone 3G carriers, Apple vary on Visual Voicemail|last=Starrett |first=Charles|date=June 11, 2008|publisher=[[iLounge]]|accessdate=May 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; feature allowing users to view a list of current voicemail messages on-screen without having to call into their voicemail. Unlike most other systems, messages can be listened to and deleted in a non-chronological order by choosing any message from an on-screen list.

A music [[ringtone]] feature was introduced in the United States on September 5, 2007. Users can create custom ringtones from songs purchased from the iTunes Store for a small additional fee. The ringtones can be 3 to 30 seconds long from any part of a song, can fade in and out, pause from half a second to five seconds when looped, or [[infinite loop|loop continuously]]. All customizing can be done in iTunes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/09/05itunes.html|title=Apple Unveils the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store|date=November 5, 2007|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=May 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively with Apple's [[GarageBand]] software 4.1.1 or later (available only on [[Mac OS X]])&lt;ref name=GarageBand1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=307108|title=How to create custom ringtones in GarageBand 4.1.1|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; or third-party tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;third party ringtones&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbertson|first=Scott|title=How to Make Custom IPhone Ringtones Without Paying Apple $2|url=http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2007/09/ringtone_hacks|work=[[Wired magazine]]|date=September 12, 2007|accessdate=March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multimedia===
The layout of the music library is similar to that of an [[iPod]] or current [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] [[S60 platform|S60]] phones. The iPhone can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, [[podcast]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from [[iTunes]]. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection. 

Users can rotate their device horizontally to [[Page orientation|landscape mode]] to access [[Cover Flow]]. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 3GS, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a [[Genius (iTunes)|Genius playlist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Voice_Control&quot;/&gt;

The iPhone supports [[gapless playback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797|title=What is Gapless Playback?|accessdate=May 13, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[iPod classic#Fifth generation|fifth-generation iPods]] introduced in 2005, the iPhone can play [[digital video]], allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in [[widescreen]]. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and [[fullscreen]] video playback.

The iPhone allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPhone. The feature originally required a Wi-Fi network, but now{{When|date=July 2010}} can use the cellular data network if one is not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/september#thu-27-wifi|title=The Reason It's Called the Wi-Fi Music Store|date=September 30, 2007|accessdate=January 6, 2008|first=John|last=Gruber|publisher=[[Daring Fireball]]|authorlink=John Gruber|work=Linked List}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPhone includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the [[#Camera|camera]]. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPhone's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from [[iPhoto]] or [[Aperture (photography software)|Aperture]] on a Mac, or [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] on a Windows [[personal computer|PC]].

===Internet connectivity===
[[File:Wikipedia on iPhone's Safari.png|thumb|Wikipedia Main Page on the iPhone [[Safari (web browser)|Safari web browser]] in landscape mode]]

Internet access is available when the iPhone is connected to a local area [[Wi-Fi]] or a wide area [[GSM]] or [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] network, both second-generation ([[2G]]) wireless data standards. The iPhone 3G introduced support for third-generation [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] and [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access|HSDPA]] 3.6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearlog.com/2008/07/apples_joswiak_iphone_3g_runs.php|title=Apple's Joswiak: iPhone 3G Runs Fast HSDPA 3.6, Not Slower 1.8|publisher=Gearlog|accessdate=October 12, 2008}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; only the iPhone 4S supports [[High-Speed Uplink Packet Access|HSUPA]] networks (14.4 Mbps), and only the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 support HSDPA 7.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macworld_3G_S&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/141031/2009/06/iphone3gs.html |title=iPhone 3GS offers speed boost, video capture|last=Michaels|first=Philip|coauthors=Jason Snell|date=June 8, 2009|work=Macworld|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

AT&amp;T introduced [[3G]] in July 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;3G rollout&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2004/07/20/at-t-wireless-introduces-3g-wireless/|title=AT&amp;T Wireless introduces 3G wireless|last=Rojas|first=Peter|date=July 20, 2004|publisher=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=December 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as late as 2007, [[Steve Jobs]] stated that it was still not widespread enough in the US, and the chipsets not energy efficient enough, to be included in the iPhone.&lt;ref name=pogueFAQ /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/09/18/jobs.uk.cell.carrier.qa/|title=Jobs: battery life issues delaying 3G iPhone|publisher=MacNN|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for [[802.1X]], an authentication system commonly used by university and corporate Wi-Fi networks, was added in the 2.0 version update.&lt;ref name=&quot;802.1x&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/au/iphone/enterprise/|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;— iPhone&amp;nbsp;— Enterprise|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 11, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By default, the iPhone will ask to join newly discovered [[Wi-Fi]] networks and prompt for the password when required. Alternatively, it can join closed Wi-Fi networks manually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306249|title=iPhone: About Connections Settings|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone will automatically choose the strongest network, connecting to Wi-Fi instead of EDGE when it is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305711|title=iPhone: Connecting to the Internet with EDGE or Wi-Fi|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the iPhone 3G, 3GS and 4 prefer [[3G]] to [[2G]], and Wi-Fi to either.&lt;ref name=&quot;3GSpeeds&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/wireless.html|title=Apple -iPhone&amp;nbsp;— Features&amp;nbsp;– 3G |year=2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wi-Fi, [[Bluetooth]], and 3G (on the iPhone 3G, 3GS, and 4) can all be deactivated individually. [[Flight mode|Airplane mode]] disables all wireless connections at once, overriding other preferences. However, once in Airplane mode, one can explicitly enable Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth modes to join and continue to operate over one or both of those networks while the cellular network transceivers remain off.

The iPhone 3GS has a maximum download rate of 7.2&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/141092/2009/06/iphone3gs_72&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.html|title=iPhone 3G S features 7.2&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, AT&amp;T's network does not|date=June 10, 2009|accessdate=May 16, 2010|work=Macworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, email attachments as well as apps and media from Apple's various stores must be smaller than 20&amp;nbsp;MB to be downloaded over a cellular network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/apple-raises-iphone-download-limit-to-20&amp;nbsp;mb/19365036/|title=Apple Increases iPhone Download Limit to 20&amp;nbsp;MB|date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=May 16, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger files, often email attachments or podcasts, must be downloaded over Wi-Fi (which has no file size limits).

[[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] is the iPhone's native [[web browser]], and it displays pages similar to its Mac and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] counterparts. Web pages may be viewed in portrait or landscape mode and the device supports automatic zooming by pinching together or spreading apart fingertips on the screen, or by double-tapping text or images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305899|title=iPhone: Zooming In to See a Page More easily|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://solution.allthingsd.com/20070626/the-iphone-is-breakthrough-handheld-computer/|title=The iPhone Is a Breakthrough Handheld Computer|author=Walter S.

Consequently, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|UK's Advertising Standards Authority]] adjudicated that an advertisement claiming the iPhone could access &quot;all parts of the internet&quot; should be withdrawn in its current form, on grounds of [[false advertising]].&lt;ref name=&quot;asaiphoneban&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_44891.htm|title=ASA Adjudications: Apple (UK) Ltd|date=August 27, 2008|accessdate=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a rare public letter in April 2010, Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] outlined the reasoning behind the absence of Flash on the iPhone (and [[iPad]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thoughts on Flash&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/|title=Thoughts on Flash|last=Jobs|first=Steve|date=April 2010|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone supports [[SVG]], [[CSS]], [[HTML]] [[Canvas (HTML element)|Canvas]], and [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iPhone Atlas OS 2.0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10115415-233.html |title=iPhone OS 2.0 will include Bonjour, full-screen Safari mode, more|last=Wilson|first=Ben|date=March 8, 2008|publisher=iPhone Atlas|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;riactant&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riactant.wordpress.com/2007/08/27/apple-iphone-tech-talk-debriefing-part-2-vector-graphics-and-animation/|title=Apple iPhone Tech Talk Debriefing&amp;nbsp;— Part 2 (Vector graphics and animation) |last=riactant|date=August 27, 2007|publisher=The General Theory of RIAtivity|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maps application can access [[Google Maps]] in map, [[satellite imagery|satellite]], or hybrid form. It can also generate directions between two locations, while providing optional real-time traffic information. During the iPhone's announcement, Jobs demonstrated this feature by searching for nearby [[Starbucks]] locations and then placing a [[prank call]] to one with a single tap.&lt;ref name=keynoteMacworld /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;keynoteEngadget&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Block|first=Ryan|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/|title=Live from Macworld 2007: Steve Jobs keynote|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=January 9, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for walking directions, public transit, and [[Google Street View|street view]] was added in the version 2.2 software update, but no voice-guided navigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;2.2&quot; /&gt; 

The iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 can orient the map with its digital compass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Compass&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-3g-s/maps-compass.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;— iPhone&amp;nbsp;— Get directions with GPS maps and a new compass|date=June 8, 2009|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 8, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple also developed a separate application to view YouTube videos on the iPhone, which streams videos after encoding them using the [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] codec. Simple weather and [[stock quote]]s applications also tap in to the Internet.

iPhone users can and do access the Internet frequently, and in a variety of places. According to [[Google]], in 2008, the iPhone generated 50 times more search requests than any other mobile handset.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleSearches&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Lane|first=Slash|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/02/14/google_iphone_usage_shocks_search_giant.html|title=Google iPhone usage shocks search giant|publisher=[[AppleInsider]]|date=February 14, 2008|accessdate=February 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Deutsche Telekom]] CEO [[René Obermann]], &quot;The average [[Internet usage]] for an iPhone customer is more than 100&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte]]s.

With the introduction of the Verizon iPhone in January 2011, the issue of using internet while on the phone has been brought to the public's attention. Under the two US carriers, internet and phone could be used simultaneously on ATT networks, whereas the Verizon networks only support for the use of each separately.&lt;ref name=&quot;TUAW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2011/01/11/verizon-iphone-cant-handle-data-and-voice-simultaneously|title=Verizon iPhone Can't Handle Data and Voice Simultaneously|last=Sande|first=Steven|date=January 11, 2011|work=The Unofficial Apple Weblog|publisher=AOL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Text input===
[[File:IPhone keyboard unblurred.jpg|thumb|The [[virtual keyboard]] on the original iPhone [[touchscreen]].]]

For text input, the iPhone implements a [[virtual keyboard]] on the touchscreen. It has automatic [[spell checker|spell checking]] and correction, [[Predictive text|predictive word]] capabilities, and a dynamic dictionary that learns new words. The keyboard can predict what word the user is typing and complete it, and correct for the accidental pressing of keys near the presumed desired key.&lt;ref name=hasAKeyboard&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=John Markoff|last=Markoff|first=John|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/technology/13phone.ready.html|title=That iPhone Has a Keyboard, but It's Not Mechanical|work=The New York Times |date=June 13, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The keys are somewhat larger and spaced farther apart when in [[landscape mode]], which is supported by only a limited number of applications. Touching a section of text for a brief time brings up a [[magnifying glass]], allowing users to place the [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] in the middle of existing text. The virtual keyboard can accommodate 21 languages, including character recognition for Chinese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keyboard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/keyboard.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;— iPhone&amp;nbsp;— Features&amp;nbsp;— Keyboard|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alternate characters with accents can be typed from the keyboard by pressing the letter for 2 seconds and selecting the alternate character from the popup.&lt;ref name=&quot;KeyboardAlternateLetters&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/tips/|title=Apple – iPhone – Tips and Tricks|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3.0 update brought support for [[cut, copy, and paste|cut, copy, or pasting]] text, as well as landscape keyboards in more applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 official&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 Macworld&quot; /&gt; On iPhone 4S, Siri allows dictation.

===Email and text messages===
The iPhone also features an email program that supports [[HTML email]], which enables the user to embed photos in an email message. [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], and [[Microsoft Powerpoint|Powerpoint]] attachments to mail messages can be viewed on the phone.&lt;ref name=3G_tech_specs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs-3g.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;— iPhone&amp;nbsp;— Technical Specifications|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's [[MobileMe]] platform offers [[push email]], which emulates the functionality of the popular [[BlackBerry]] email solution, for an annual subscription. [[Yahoo!]] offers a free push-email service for the iPhone. [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] (although not [[Push-IMAP]]) and [[Post Office Protocol|POP3]] mail standards are also supported, including [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/enterprise/|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;— iPhone&amp;nbsp;— Enterprise|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=May 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kerio Connect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Anthony|last=Frausto-Robledo|url=http://www.architosh.com/news/2007-07/2007a0724_an-kerioiphone.html|title=Analysis: Kerio MailServer delivers email to Apple iPhone|date=July 24, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the first versions of the iPhone firmware, this was accomplished by opening up IMAP on the Exchange server. Apple has also licensed [[ActiveSync|Microsoft ActiveSync]] and now{{When|date=July 2010}} supports the platform (including push email) with the release of iPhone 2.0 firmware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2008/03/06/apple-iphone-sdk-event/|title=iPhone to support Exchange|date=March 6, 2008|publisher=[[Barron's Magazine|Barron's]]|work=TechTraderDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=releasedate /&gt; The iPhone will sync email account settings over from Apple's own [[Mail (application)|Mail]] application, [[Microsoft Outlook]], and [[Microsoft Entourage]], or it can be manually configured on the device itself. With the correct settings, the email program can access almost any IMAP or POP3 account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/mail.html|title=iPhone—Features—Mail|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=May 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Text messages are presented chronologically in a mailbox format similar to Mail, which places all text from recipients together with replies. Text messages are displayed in speech bubbles (similar to [[iChat]]) under each recipient's name. The iPhone has built-in support for emailmessage forwarding, drafts, and direct internal camera-to-email picture sending. Support for multi-recipient SMS was added in the 1.1.3 software update.&lt;ref name=&quot;1.1.3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/131616/2008/01/iphone_update.html|title=First Look: iPhone 1.1.3|last=Moren|first=Dan|date=January 16, 2008|work=Macworld|accessdate=June 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] was added in the 3.0 update, but not for the original iPhone&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 official&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/preview-iphone-os/|title=The most advanced mobile OS.

===Third-party applications===
:''See also: [[iOS SDK]] and [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]'' &lt;!--Not templated due to piped link.--&gt;

At [[Worldwide Developers Conference#WWDC 2007|WWDC 2007]] on June 11, 2007, Apple announced that the iPhone would support [[third-party developer|third-party]] &quot;web applications&quot; written in [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] that share the look and feel of the iPhone interface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Web apps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/11iphone.html|title=iPhone to Support Third-Party Web 2.0 Applications|date=June 11, 2007|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 17, 2007, Steve Jobs, in an open letter posted to Apple's &quot;Hot News&quot; [[weblog]], announced that a [[software development kit]] (SDK) would be made available to third-party developers in February 2008. The iPhone SDK was officially announced and released on March 6, 2008, at the Apple Town Hall facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/live-from-apples-iphone-press-conference/|title=Live from Apple's iPhone SDK press conference|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=March 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is a free download, with an Apple registration, that allows developers to develop native applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch, then test them in an &quot;iPhone simulator&quot;. However, loading an application onto a real device is only possible after paying an [[Apple Developer Connection]] membership fee. Developers are free to set any price for their applications to be distributed through the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], of which they will receive a 70% share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michelle |last=Quinn |title=Apple will open App Store in bid to boost iPhone sales |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-iphone10-2008jul10,0,3798678.story |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Developers can also opt to release the application for free and will not pay any costs to release or distribute the application beyond the membership fee. The App Store was launched with the release of iOS 2.0, on July 11, 2008.&lt;ref name=releasedate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/06/09iphone.html|title=Apple Introduces the New iPhone 3G|quote=iPhone 2.0 software will be available on July 11 as a free software update via iTunes 7.7 or later for all iPhone customers|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The update was free for iPhone users; owners of older iPod Touches were required to pay US$10 for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/134502/2008/07/ipodtouch.html|title=Is the iPod touch 2.0 update worth $10?|last=Breen|first=Christopher|date=July 15, 2008|work=Macworld|accessdate=May 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a developer has submitted an application to the App Store, Apple holds firm control over its distribution.

===Vulnerability===
In 2007, 2010, and 2011, developers released a series of tools called [[JailbreakMe]] that used security vulnerabilities in Mobile Safari rendering in order to [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbreak]] the device (which allows users to install any compatible software on the device instead of only App Store apps).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10115225-233.html |title=One-step method for adding third-party apps to iPhone 1.1.1, iPod Touch debuts |date=October 29, 2007 |publisher=CNET |author= Ben Wilson |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/01/official-iphone-4-jailbreak-hits-from-iphone-dev-team/ |title=Official: iPhone 4 jailbreak hits from iPhone Dev Team (updated with video) |publisher=Engadget |date= August 1, 2010 |author=  Sean Hollister |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jailbreakme-informationweek&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Apple iOS Zero-Day PDF Vulnerability Exposed |author= Mathew J.

Apple has filed more than 200 [[patent application]]s related to the technology behind the iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ishimaru|first=Heather|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/business&amp;id=4920783|title=Apple Options Not An Issue At Macworld|publisher=[[KGO-TV|abc7news.com]]|date=January 9, 2007|accessdate=January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/index.html#technology|publisher=Apple Inc.|title=iPhone&amp;nbsp;— Features&amp;nbsp;— High Technology|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LG Electronics claimed the design of the iPhone was copied from the [[LG Prada (KE850)|LG Prada]]. Woo-Young Kwak, head of LG Mobile Handset R&amp;D Center, said at a press conference: &quot;we consider that Apple copied Prada phone after the design was unveiled when it was presented in the iF Design Award and won the prize in September 2006.&quot;&lt;ref name=am&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.applematters.com/article/the-iphone-lawsuits/|title=The iPhone Lawsuits|publisher=Apple Matters|first=Aaron|last=Wright|date=February 20, 2007|accessdate=June 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, Apple applied for the &quot;iPhone&quot; trademark in the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, and the European Union. A Canadian application followed in October 2004, and a New Zealand application in September 2006. As of October 2006, only the Singapore and Australian applications had been granted. In September 2006, a company called Ocean Telecom Services applied for an &quot;iPhone&quot; trademark in the United States, United Kingdom and Hong Kong, following a filing in Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=C&amp;trademark=E5341301|title=Case details for Community Trade Mark E5341301|publisher=[[UK Intellectual Property Office]]|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the Ocean Telecom trademark applications use exactly the same wording as the New Zealand application of Apple, it is assumed that Ocean Telecom is applying on behalf of Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://10layers.com/2006/10/apple-filing-for-iphone-trademarks-worldwide/|title=Apple filing for iPhone trademarks worldwide|publisher=10layers.com|date=October 17, 2006|accessdate=January 28, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070113014820/http://10layers.com/2006/10/apple-filing-for-iphone-trademarks-worldwide/|archivedate=January 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian application was opposed in August 2005, by a Canadian company called [[Comwave]] who themselves applied for the trademark three months later.

In December 2010, [[Reuters]] reported that some iPhone and [[iPad]] users were suing [[Apple Inc]] because some applications were passing user information to third-party advertisers without permission.

Since April 20, 2011, a [[hidden file|hidden]] [[encryption|unencrypted]] file on the iPhone and other iOS devices has been widely discussed in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.csvance.com/?p=136 | title=Consolidated.db : Final Thoughts | author=Christopher Vance | date=April 20, 2011 | accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/04/iphone-tracks/ | title=iPhone Tracks Your Every Move, and There’s a Map for That | publisher=[[Wired.com]] | date=April 20, 2011 | accessdate=April 22, 2011 | author=Chen, Brian X.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that the file, labeled &quot;consolidated.db&quot;, constantly stores the iPhone user's movement by approximating geographic locations calculated by triangulating nearby cell phone towers, a technology proven to be inaccurate at times.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Reilly&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/04/more-iphone-tracking-research.html | title=Additional iPhone tracking research | publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] | date=April 24, 2011 | accessdate=April 25, 2011 | author=Warden, Pete}}&lt;/ref&gt; The file was released with the June 2010 update of Apple [[iOS4]] and may contain almost one year's worth of data.

[[F-Secure]] discovered that the data is transmitted to Apple twice a day and postulate that Apple is using the information to construct their global location database similar to the ones constructed by Google and [[Skyhook Wireless|Skyhook]] through [[wardriving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002145.html | title=Actually, iPhone sends your location to Apple twice a day | author=[[Mikko Hypponen]] | date=April 21, 2011 | accessdate=April 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, unlike the [[Google]] &quot;Latitude&quot; application, which performs a similar task on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones, the file is not dependent upon signing a specific [[EULA]] or even the user's knowledge, but it is stated in the 15,200 word-long [[terms and conditions]] of the iPhone that ''&quot;Apple and [their] partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of [the user's] Apple computer or device&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/20/iphone-tracking-prompts-privacy-fears | title=iPhone keeps record of everywhere you go |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=April 20, 2011 | accessdate=April 22, 2011 | author=Arthur, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The file is also automatically copied onto the user's computer once synchronized with the iPhone.

Apple tightly controls certain aspects of the iPhone. According to [[Jonathan Zittrain]], the emergence of [[closed device]]s like the iPhone have made computing more [[proprietary software|proprietary]] than early versions of [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Braiker|title=A Killer Product: Will closed devices like Apple's iPhone murder the Web?|date=2008-05-02|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/135150|accessdate = 2009-06-16|quote= Through historical accident, we've ended up with a global network that pretty much allows anybody to communicate with anyone else at any time. Devices could be reprogrammed by them at any time, including code written by other people, so you don't have to be a nerd to get the benefits of reprogramming it. [But] this is an historical accident. Now, I see a movement away from that framework—even though it doesn't feel like a movement away. [For example,] an iPhone can only be changed by Steve Jobs or soon, with the software development kit, by programmers that he personally approves that go through his iPhone apps store. Or whimsical applications that run on the Facebook platform or the new Google apps. These are controllable by their vendors in ways that Bill Gates never dreamed of controlling Windows applications. [...] That's the ironic thing. Bill Gates is Mr. Proprietary. But for my purposes, even under the standard Windows operating system from 1990, 1991, you write the code, you can hand it to somebody else and they can run it. Bill Gates has nothing to say about it. So it's funny to think that by moving in Steve Jobs's direction it actually ends up far more proprietary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] community has found many workarounds, most of which are disallowed by Apple and threaten to void the device's warranty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iphonealley.com/news/do-iphone-hacks-void-your-warranty|title=Do iPhone Hacks Void Your Warranty?|last=Johnston|first=Michael|date=October 20, 2007|publisher=iPhone Alley|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[iOS jailbreaking|Jailbreaking]]&quot; allows users to install apps not available on the App Store or modify basic functionality. SIM unlocking allows the iPhone to be used on a different carrier's network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/132675/2008/03/iphone_sdk_jailbreak.html|title=iPhone hackers look to an uncertain future|last=Moren|first=Dan|date=May 28, 2008|work=Macworld|accessdate=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activation===
The iPhone normally prevents access to its media player and web features unless it has also been activated as a phone with an authorized carrier. On July 3, 2007, [[Jon Lech Johansen]] reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked the iPhone's other features with a combination of custom software and modification of the iTunes binary. He published the software and offsets for others to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nanocr.eu/2007/07/03/iphone-without-att/|title=iPhone Independence Day|publisher=nanocr.eu|first=Jon Lech|last=Johansen|authorlink=Jon Lech Johansen|date=July 3, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the original, the iPhone 3G must be activated in the store in most countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maclife.com/article/iphone_3g_in_store_activation_only|title=iPhone 3G&amp;nbsp;— In-Store Activation Only|publisher=[[MacLife]]|first=Roberto|last=Baldwin|date=June 9, 2008|accessdate=June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the iPhone 3G more difficult, but not impossible, to hack. The need for in-store activation, as well as the huge number of first-generation iPhone and [[iPod Touch]] users upgrading to iPhone OS 2.0, caused a worldwide [[Web server#Overload causes|overload]] of Apple's [[server (computing)|servers]] on July 11, 2008, the day on which both the iPhone 3G and iPhone OS 2.0 updates as well as [[MobileMe]] were released. After the update, devices were required to connect to Apple's servers to authenticate the update, causing many devices to be temporarily unusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/business/12iphone.html |title=iPhone Users Plagued by Software Problems.|work=The New York Times |first=John|last=Markoff | authorlink = John Markoff |date=July 12, 2008|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Apple released the 3.0 software two days before the iPhone 3GS to avoid such issues.

Users on the [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]] network in the United Kingdom, however, can buy the phone online and activate it via iTunes as with the previous model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/uk/browse/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone |title=iPhone 3G|publisher=Apple Store (U.K.)|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even where not required, vendors usually offer activation for the buyer's convenience. In the U.S., Apple has begun to offer free shipping on both the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3GS (when available), reversing the in-store activation requirement. [[Best Buy]] and [[Wal-Mart]] will also sell the iPhone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buy iPhone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/buy/|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;— iPhone&amp;nbsp;— Buy iPhone 3G|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unapproved third-party software and jailbreaking===
{{See also|iOS jailbreaking|iPhone Dev Team}}

The iPhone's operating system is designed to only run software that has an Apple-approved [[code signing|cryptographic signature]]. This restriction can be overcome by &quot;jailbreaking&quot; the phone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-9806428-37.htm|title=iPhone jailbreak for the masses released|last=Krazit|first=Tom|date=October 19, 2007|publisher=CNET news|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involves replacing the iPhone's [[firmware]] with a slightly modified version that does not enforce the signature check. Doing so may be a circumvention of Apple's [[technical protection measures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/commentary/circuitcourt/2007/08/circuitcourt_0829|title=Legal or Not, IPhone Hacks Might Spur Revolution|last=Granick|first=Jennifer|date=August 28, 2007|work=Wired|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple, in a statement to the [[United States Copyright Office]] in response to [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] lobbying for a DMCA exception for this kind of hacking, claimed that jailbreaking the iPhone would be [[copyright infringement]] due to the necessary modification of system software.&lt;ref name=&quot;iphone-dmca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10163675-37.html|title=Apple: iPhone jailbreaking violates our copyright|last=Krazit|first=Tom|date=February 23, 2009|publisher=News.com|accessdate=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in 2010 Jailbreaking was declared officially legal in the [[United States]] by the [[DMCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redmondpie.com/jailbreak-unlock-iphone-officially-legal/ | title=Jailbreaking and Unlocking is Now Officially Legal in United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jailbroken iPhones may be susceptible to computer viruses, but few such incidents have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/09/2737673.htm Australian admits creating first iPhone virus], Brigid Andersen, [[ABC Online]], November 9, 2009.

===SIM unlocking===
====United States====

Most iPhones were and are still sold with a [[SIM lock]], which restricts the use of the phone to one particular carrier, a common practice with subsidized [[GSM]] phones. Unlike most GSM phones however, the phone cannot be officially unlocked by entering a code. The locked/unlocked state is maintained on Apple's servers per [[IMEI]] and is set when the iPhone is activated.

While the iPhone was initially [[AT&amp;T, the iPhone, and Tying of Smartphones and Service Providers|sold in the US only on the AT&amp;T network]] with a SIM lock in place, various hackers have found methods to &quot;[[Unlock phone|unlock]]&quot; the phone from a specific network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/60045/iphone_sim_unlocking.html?loomia_ow=t0:s0:a38:g26:r1:c0.001557:b21009213|title=Unlocking an iPhone|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|date=November 14, 2007|work=Macworld|accessdate=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon are the only authorized iPhone carriers in the United States, unlocked iPhones can be used with other carriers after unlocking.&lt;ref name=bw&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2008/tc2008091_106953.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_news+++analysis|title=What's Hot: Used Apple iPhones: After the iPhone 3G launch, consumers want the original, hackable iPhone, and vendors are springing up to sell them—for a premium|last=Kharif|first=Olga|work=BusinessWeek  |date=September 2, 2008|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an unlocked iPhone may be used on the T-Mobile network in the U.S. but, while an unlocked iPhone is compatible with T-Mobile's ''voice'' network, it may not be able to make use of 3G functionality (i.e., no mobile web or e-mail, etc).&lt;ref name=&quot;AppleInsider, January 11, 2012&quot;&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/01/11/t_mobile_ceo_says_frequency_band_issue_is_key_reason_for_lack_of_iphone.html T-Mobile CEO says frequency band issue is 'key reason' for lack of iPhone].

====Other countries====
In the [[United Kingdom]], carriers [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]], [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]], [[Hutchison 3G|3]], [[Vodafone U.K.|Vodafone]], [[T-mobile (UK)|T-Mobile]], as well as [[mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]] [[Tesco Mobile]] sell the device under subsidised contracts, or for use on pay as you go. They are locked to network initially, though are usually able to be unlocked either after a certain period of contract length has passed, or for a small fee. The iPhone 4 in the UK is also currently sold unlocked without a contract for full retail price for use on any network the user chooses, but only when bought directly from Apple (either online or in their physical shops).&lt;ref name=&quot;iPhone is sold SIM free and customer can choose carrier.&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/uk/browse/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone |title=Buy iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS – Apple Store (UK) |publisher=Store.apple.com |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4 can also be bought unlocked from a Apple Retail Store, or the Apple Online Store.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrier unlocking list&quot; /&gt;

All new mobile phones sold by carriers in [[Canada]] are locked, and none of the major carriers ([[Rogers Wireless]], [[Telus]], [[Bell Mobility]]) unlock iPhones, even after service contracts have come to an end. [[Cell Phone Freedom Act (Bill C-560)|Legislation]] has been introduced that would compel carriers to unlock mobile phones (including iPhones) outside of contract, upon customer request.  iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S can be bought unlocked from Apple Retail stores or from Apple Online Store. 

Internationally, policies vary, but many carriers sell the iPhone unlocked for full retail price.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrier unlocking list&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1937|title=About activating iPhone 3G with a wireless carrier|date=December 13, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original '''Apple Computer''', also known retroactively as the '''Apple I''', or '''Apple-1''', is a personal computer released by the Apple Computer Company (now [[Apple Inc.]]) in 1976. They were designed and [[Handicraft|hand-built]] by [[Steve Wozniak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.oneindia.in/2006/09/27/co-founder-tells-his-side-of-apple-story-1159346150.html |title=Co-founder tells his side of Apple story |publisher=Reuters |date=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6167297 NPR : A Chat with Computing Pioneer Steve Wozniak]&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak's friend [[Steve Jobs]] had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only means of transportation, a VW van.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/aug/30/kelley-jobs-vision-changed-the-way-we-work-play/?opinion=1 Kelley: Jobs' vision changed the way we work, play]&lt;/ref&gt; It was demonstrated in April 1976 at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] in Palo Alto, California.

==History==
The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 at a price of {{USD|666.66}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/1606-2-5937610.html|title=Video: Wozniak: $666.66 seemed like a good idea|date=November 7, 2005|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Wozniak &quot;liked repeating digits&quot; and because they originally sold it to a local shop for $500 plus a one-third markup.&lt;ref name=&quot;iWoz&quot;&gt;[[Steve Wozniak|Wozniak, Steven]]: &quot;[[iWoz]]&quot;, page 180. [[W. W. Norton]], 2006. ISBN 978-0-393-06143-7&lt;/ref&gt; About 200 units were produced. Unlike other hobbyist computers of its day, which were sold as kits, the Apple I was a fully assembled circuit board containing about 60+ chips. However, to make a working computer, users still had to add a case, power supply transformers, power switch, ASCII keyboard, and composite video display. An optional board providing a cassette interface for storage was later released at a cost of $75.

[[File:Apple 1 Advertisement Oct 1976.jpg | thumb | left | Introductory advertisement for the Apple I Computer]]
The Apple I's built-in [[computer terminal]] circuitry was distinctive. All one needed was a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] and an inexpensive [[television set]]. Competing machines such as the [[Altair 8800]] generally were programmed with front-mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights (red [[light-emitting diode|LED]]s, most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a [[ASR33|teletypewriter machine]]. This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day. In April 1977 the price was dropped to $475.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2703 April 1977 Price List | Applefritter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the [[Apple II]] in April 1977, which began shipping in June of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2715 Bill of Sale | Applefritter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Apple dropped the Apple I from its price list by October 1977, officially discontinuing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2707 October 1977 Price List | Applefritter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As Wozniak was the only person who could answer most customer support questions about the computer, the company offered Apple I owners discounts and trade-ins for Apple IIs to persuade them to return their computers, contributing to their scarcity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ah04&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/ | title=The Apple II, cont. | accessdate=February 27, 2011 | work=Apple II History}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Concord High School Junior Wai Lee assembled one of the first 12 Apple 1's (no serial number) the first Apple Computer in an aluminum housing. 

As of 2008, an estimated 40 to 50{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Apple I computers are still known to exist, making it a very rare [[collectable|collector's item]]. An Apple I reportedly sold for $50,000 USD at auction in 1999, with another apparently selling in 2009 for $17,500; however, a more typical price for an Apple I is in the $14,000–$16,000 range.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In November 2009 the Apple I with serial number 82 was listed on eBay with a starting bid of $50,000 but it is unreported as to whether the computer was sold. However, in November 2010, this same Apple I (with serial number 82) sold for the equivalent of $US178,000 ($US213,600 including the 'buyer's premium') at Christie's auction house in London,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11825954 BBC News November 24, 2010 00:48]&lt;/ref&gt; making it by far the highest price paid for this model to date, at {{GBP|133,250}} ($210,000). The high value of this particular example is likely due to the rare documents and packaging offered in the sale rather than the computer itself; namely (and amongst others) the original packaging (with the return label showing Steve Jobs' parents' address, the original Apple Computer Inc 'headquarters' being their garage), a personally typed and signed letter from Jobs (answering technical questions about the computer) and the original invoice showing 'Steven' as the salesman.

The '''Apple Retail Store'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/retail/]&lt;/ref&gt; is a chain of [[retailer|retail stores]] owned and operated by [[Apple Inc.]], dealing in computers and consumer electronics. The stores sell [[Macintosh]] [[personal computer]]s, [[computer software|software]], [[iPod]]s, [[iPad]]s, [[iPhone]]s, third-party accessories, and other consumer electronics such as [[Apple TV]]. Many stores feature a Theatre for presentations and workshops and a Studio for training with Apple products; all stores offer a [[Genius Bar]] for technical support and repairs, as well as free workshops available to the public. Under the leadership of [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]], the former Senior Vice President of Retail Operations, the Apple Stores have been responsible for &quot;[turning] the boring computer sales floor into a sleek playroom filled with gadgets&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/business/economy/15shop.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first1=Stephanie | last1=Clifford | first2=Miguel | last2=Helft | title=Ron Johnson, Apple Stores Chief, to Lead J.C. Penney | date=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012|01}}, Apple has opened 361 stores worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/retail/storelist Apple Retail Store - Store List]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Many stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has since built several stand-alone &quot;flagship&quot; stores in high-profile locations. Flagship stores have opened in [[Palo Alto]], [[Boston]], [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]], [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], [[London]], [[Sydney]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Montreal]], [[Munich]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Zurich]], [[Paris]], [[Beijing]], [[Glasgow]], [[Honolulu]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Hong Kong]]. The largest Apple Store in the world is in [[Covent Garden]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]; the largest in North America is in [[Boston]].

Each store is designed to suit the needs of the location and regulatory authorities. Apple has received numerous architectural awards for its store designs, particularly its midtown Manhattan location on [[Fifth Avenue]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Fifth Ave&quot;&gt;{{cite news|date = 2006-05-19|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/19/technology/19apple.html?ex=1305691200&amp;en=0a5d2e724d58ac68&amp;ei=5090|title = Apple, a Success at Stores, Bets Big on Fifth Avenue|publisher = The New York Times |accessdate = 2006-05-19 | first=Steve | last=Lohr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IDSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 2002|url = http://www.idsa.org/idea/idea2002/G7001.htm|title = Apple Computer Retail Stores: Gold, Environments|publisher = [[Industrial Designers Society of America]]|accessdate = 2006-05-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060214005509/http://www.idsa.org/idea/idea2002/G7001.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose glass cube was designed by [[Bohlin Cywinski Jackson]].&lt;ref name=aia&gt;{{cite news|first=Inga|last=Saffron|title=In Memorium: Bernard Cywinski, Paterfamilias Of Philadelphia Architecture |url=http://network.aia.org/AIA/CommitteeonDesign/Home/InMemoriumBernardCywinski/Default.aspx |work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |publisher=[[American Institute of Architects]] |date=2003-03-06 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Apple Stores feature glass staircases,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/glass_staircase_list.html]&lt;/ref&gt; which for multi-level stores was originally intended to attract customers to visit the upper floors, and some even feature a glass bridge. The [[New York Times]] wrote that these features were part of then-CEO [[Steve Jobs]]' extensive attention to detail. The first glass staircase received a design patent in 2002 from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with Jobs' name first, followed by several others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/technology/apple-patents-show-steve-jobss-attention-to-design.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Miguel | last1=Helft | first2=Shan | last2=Carter | title=Apple Patents Show Steve Jobs's Attention to Design | date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/08/24/technology/steve-jobs-patents.html | work=The New York Times | first=Shan | last=Carter | title=Steve Jobs's Patents | date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the staircase design itself received a design patent, and the complex glass and hardware system received a separate technical patent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.ifoman.com.s3.amazonaws.com/staircase_page_patent_c.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Apple worked with architect [[Bohlin Cywinski Jackson]] and engineer [[Eckersley O’Callaghan Structural Design]] in designing the staircase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/glass_staircase.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eckersleyocallaghan.com/projects/commercial.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apple Store in [[Regent Street]], [[London]], was the first to open in Europe in November 2004, and is the most profitable shop in London with the highest sales per square foot, taking £60,000,000 pa, or £2,000 per square foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple Store London&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 2010|url = http://www.macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/apple_store_regent_street_the_most_profitable_shop_in_london_for_its_size/|title = Apple Store London|publisher = [[macdailynews]]|accessdate = 2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Regent Street store was surpassed in size by the nearby Apple Store in [[Covent Garden]], which is currently the biggest Apple store in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-10898866 World's biggest Apple store opens in Covent Garden]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]], Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011, was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, however he had had no control over the inventory in the stores. Instead, inventory is done company wide by then-COO and now CEO [[Tim Cook]] who has a background in [[supply-chain management]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/ | work=CNN | title=Senior Editor at Large}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

==History==
[[Steve Jobs]], the co-founder of Apple, returned as interim CEO in 1997. According to Jobs biographer [[Walter Isaacson]], Jobs began a concerted campaign to help sales by improving the retail presentation of Macintosh computers. Even with new products launched under Job's watch like the [[iMac G3|iMac]] and the [[PowerBook G3]] and an online store, Apple still relied heavily on big box computer and electronics stores for most of their sales. There, customers continued to deal with poorly trained and ill-maintained Mac sections which did not foster customer loyalty to Apple and nor did they help differentiate the Mac user-experience from Windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;applematters1&quot;&gt;[http://www.applematters.com/article/best-buy-and-apple-together-again/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobs' first priority was ending almost every big box retailer's ties to the Apple, except for [[CompUSA]] who retained its Apple contract by agreeing to adopt Apple's &quot;store within a store&quot; concept. This required that approximately 15% of each CompUSA store would be set aside for Mac hardware and software (including non-Apple products) and would play host to a part-time Apple salesperson. However the &quot;store within a store&quot; approach was not successful in part because the Apple section was in the lowest-traffic area of CompUSA stores. Jobs and his executives saw that they didn't have enough control over the presentation of Apple products so they decided on creating an Apple retail store.&lt;ref name=&quot;topmdi1&quot;&gt;[http://topmdi.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1861:steve-jobs-29-eng&amp;catid=198:steve-jobs-english&amp;Itemid=274]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lowendmac&gt;[http://lowendmac.com/orchard/08th/roots-of-the-apple-store.html The Roots of Apple's Retail Stores]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;applematters1&quot;/&gt;

In 1999, Jobs personally recruited [[Millard Drexler]] to serve on Apple's board of directors, Drexler was the CEO of [[Gap Inc.]] whose explosive growth had been attributed to retailing environments and marketing rather than its products or competitive prices. Drexler was one of the few directors who supported Jobs' retail stores initiative, the others on the board were skeptical as this would compete with their third party retailers, and also as [[Gateway, Inc.]] had struggled with its own stores. In 2000, Jobs hired [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]] from [[Target Corporation|Target]], where he had been vice president of merchandising responsible for launching the Michael Graves line of consumer products that raised Target's image beyond that of just an upscale K-Mart. At Drexler's suggestion, Johnson then built a mock-up of an Apple store inside a warehouse near the company's headquarters in Cupertino.

On May 15, 2001, Jobs hosted a press event at Apple's first store at the [[Tysons Corner Center]] mall in [[Tysons Corner]], Virginia. Jobs led a group of journalists from a hotel in [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]], Virginia, to Apple's first store in the second level of [[Tysons Corner Center]] for a commemorative press event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/retail/retailers-electronics-appliance-retailing-computer/13434795.html Remembering Apple's First Store]&lt;/ref&gt; The first two Apple Stores opened on May 19 in Tysons Corner and the same day in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], California at [[Glendale Galleria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline2&quot;&gt;[http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/chronology_2.html Timeline of Apple Stores.]&lt;/ref&gt; The first Apple Store with the current layout and hardware (wood tables and stone flooring) opened in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California.

The Apple Store design has resulted from the contributions of firms such as [[Bohlin Cywinski Jackson]], Eckersley O’Callaghan, [[Eight Inc.]], [[Gensler]], and ISP Design, Inc., together with Apple's in-house design team. Eight Inc. had first been responsible for the unsuccessful CompUSA foray which was due to limited space and budget, but with the Apple retail store they had the freedom to come up with an approach that broadly resembled [[Gap Inc.]] stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;topmdi1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=lowendmac /&gt;

===Expansion and changes===
Several publications and analysts predicted the failure of Apple Stores, based on sales made per square foot which was a standard metric in computer retail at the time. It was thought that because of the stores' diminutive size and non-aggressive sales team, Apple would succeed in presenting the Mac but fail in making a significant number of sales, despite the huge turnout for the Virginia store (7,700 in the first day purchases). However, Apple proved its critics wrong and by 2007 it ranked among the top retailers in the world. Apple opened its 200th store on October 26, 2007 in [[Gilbert, Arizona|Gilbert]], Arizona, 2,251 days after opening its Tysons Corner store.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifoapplestore.com/db/2007/10/16/apple-nearing-milestone-opening/ Apple nearing milestone opening]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Fortune Magazine]]; &quot;and not just the architecture. [[Saks Fifth Avenue|Saks]], whose flagship store is down the street, generates sales of $362 per square foot a year. [[Best Buy]] stores turn $930 - tops for electronics retailers - while [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]] takes in $2,666. [[Audrey Hepburn]] liked Tiffany's for breakfast, but at $4,032 per square foot, Apple is eating everyone's lunch&quot;.&lt;ref name=lowendmac /&gt;

Apple has since re-established ties with major big box retailers like [[Best Buy]], as these chains have considerably more geographical reach than the existing network of Apple Stores. The relationship with Best Buy calls for the company to send Apple Solutions Consultants (ASCs) to train Best Buy employees to be familiar with Apple's product lineup and how Macs work.&lt;ref name=&quot;applematters1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2006/06/7129.ars]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Originally, Apple Stores contained a dedicated [[point of sale]] station. However, in 2006, Apple began introducing a new store layout and design with surgical-grade stainless steel walls and backlit signage. The new store design replaced the dedicated point of sale station with the handheld EasyPay system. A dedicated point of sale station still exists in most of these stores to facilitate transactions not paid for by [[credit card]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Store Re-design Photos&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date = 2006-09-22|url = http://www.ifoapplestore.com/2006/09/22/first-re-design-photos/|title = Store Redesign Photos|publisher=ifo Apple Store|accessdate = 2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EasyPay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 2006|url = http://addingunderstanding.com/2005/12/apple-stores-easy-pay|title = Apple Store's Easy Pay|publisher=Adding Understanding blog|accessdate = 2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regent Street store has more point of sale terminals than any other store. Only flagship stores and a few older locations have a dedicated point of sale; all other stores have a POS behind the Genius Bar. Apple has recently changed their EasyPay systems to operate on [[iPod Touch]] instead of the previous Windows-based system. The iPods feature a custom housing, the Infinite Peripherals Linēa-Pro barcode scanner and card reader, to allow the same transactions on the iPod.

On May 22, 2011, Apple replaced their acrylic displays that had information about the product with interactive [[iPad 2]] displays, which add more information about the product like information about the specifications, comparisons and extended warranties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benzinga.com/11/05/1102720/update-first-look-at-‘apple-store-2-0′-in-australia First look at ‘Apple Store 2.0′ in Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; This transition from paper to intuitive touch displays was dubbed &quot;Apple Store 2.0&quot; by online blogs such as [[Engadget]] and [[Gizmodo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/22/apple-store-celebrates-10th-anniversary-with-2-0-experience-ipa/&lt;/ref&gt;

The successful experience that Apple had with its retail stores has been applied to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] stores, since Jobs was elected to that company's board of directors in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/article/143263/2009/10/disney_retail.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genius Bar==
[[Image:Apple Genius Bar Regentstreet London.jpg|thumb|right|The Genius Bar at Apple Store Regent Street, London.]]
{{Main|Genius Bar}}
All Apple Stores feature a Genius Bar, where customers can receive technical advice or set up service and repair for their products. The Genius Bar provides software support for [[Mac OS X]] and hardware service on products that are not classified [http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304210 vintage or obsolete]. However, in most cases the Geniuses will at least attempt to assist customers with older hardware.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacSE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 2005|url = http://50lbslater.com/blog/?p=45 |title = Old School Genius|publisher = Tech Today|accessdate = 2006-10-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061015013900/http://50lbslater.com/blog/?p=45 |archivedate = 2006-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, visitors to the Genius Bar were offered free [[Evian]] water. Apple dropped this amenity in February 2002.

To address increasing numbers of [[iPod]] customers at the Genius Bar, some new stores also feature an iPod Bar. First seen at the [[Ginza]] store in [[Tokyo]], then at the [[New York City|New York]] locations, the iPod Bar has become a common feature at newly built stores.&lt;ref name=&quot;iPod Bar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year = 2005|url = http://us.gizmodo.com/gadgets/portable-media/ipod-bar-japan-great-service-but-the-cocktails-need-work-139631.php|title = iPod Bar Japan: Great Service But The Cocktails Need Work|publisher = [[Gizmodo]]|accessdate = 2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most new stores feature a station called The Studio, a Genius Bar-like setting where customers can meet with a &quot;Creative&quot; and receive help with projects ranging from organizing a photo album to music composition to film editing. Some of the older stores are being considered to carry a Studio in a future remodel, in some cases replacing the older theaters.

==Store openings==
Store openings have become special events among avid [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] users.{{cn|date=October 2011}} Opening day attracts thousands of customers who line up early in the morning or even the night before.{{cn|date=October 2011}} Most openings are accompanied by giveaways of prizes such as t-shirts and &quot;[[Fukubukuro|lucky bags]]&quot; at flagship store openings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ifo_AppleStore&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date = November 28, 2005|url = http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/lucky_bags.html|title = Grand Opening Lucky Bags|publisher = ifo Apple Store|accessdate = 2006-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://shanghaiist.com/2010/07/08/preview_shanghais_first_apple_store.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
The first two Apple Stores opened in the [[United States]] in 2001 (see [[#Design and history|history]] above). In 2003, Apple expanded its operations into [[Japan]], opening the first store outside of the United States. This was followed by the opening of stores in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Italy]], [[Australia]], [[China]], [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[France]] and [[Spain]]. In 2010 a major effort to expand sales in China was announced along with opening of a store in Shanghai.&lt;ref name = &quot;China Push&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/technology/09apple.html &quot;Apple Making New Push Into China&quot;] article by David Barboza in ''[[The New York Times]]'' July 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Apple Store in [[Hong Kong]], being the 100th overseas store outside the [[United States]] opened on September 24, 2011, occupying Podium 1 and 2 of [[ifc mall]].

==Apple Company Store==
The Apple Company Store is found on the [[Apple Campus]] in One Infinite Loop.  This store is the original Apple Employee store, and is open to the public.  The store does not sell any of Apple's computer or iPod lineups, and it does not provide on-site support or repairs.  However, it is the only place where Apple T-Shirts, hats, and other such merchandise can be purchased.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apple.com/companystore/&lt;/ref&gt;  Apple products are on display here, and various software and accessories can be purchased as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yelp.com/biz/apple-company-store-cupertino-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knockoffs==
{{main|Unauthorized Apple Stores in China}}
In July 2011, an American expatriate blogger who lives in the southwestern Chinese city of [[Kunming]] reported on her discovery of what she called &quot;the best ripoff store we had ever seen&quot;—a fake Apple Store, complete with the glass exterior, wood display tables, winding staircase and large promotional posters found in legitimate Apple Stores, and with employees wearing lanyards and the same T-shirts as actual Apple Store employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ultimate knockoff&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2011/07/21/the-ultimate-knock-off-a-fake-apple-store/ |title=The Ultimate Knock-Off: A Fake Apple Store |first=Loretta |last=Chao |work=China Real Time Report |publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that the store had &quot;gotten widespread international attention for the remarkable lengths to which its proprietors seem to have gone to mimic the look and feel of a real Apple Store.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fake clerk&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2011/07/21/china-fake-apple-store-clerk-speaks-out/ |title=Fake Apple Store Clerk Speaks out |first=Loretta |last=Chao |coauthors=Feng, Sue |work=China Real Time Report |publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese law prohibits retailers from copying the look and feel of competitors' stores, but enforcement is lax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters followup&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/25/us-apple-china-fake-idUSTRE76O0M720110725 |title=Chinese city orders two fake Apple Stores to close |first=Melanie |last=Lee |work=Reuters |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''WSJ'', unauthorized Apple resellers are found throughout China; the blogger's original post noted that two such stores were located within walking distance of the first knockoff, one of them with a misspelled sign reading &quot;Apple Stoer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fake clerk&quot;/&gt; An employee of the first knockoff confirmed that the store was not one of the 13&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters followup&quot;/&gt; authorized Apple resellers in Kunming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ultimate knockoff&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fake clerk&quot;/&gt; In a follow-up report, [[Reuters]] indicated that local authorities in Kunming had closed two fake Apple stores in that city due to lack of official business permits, but allowed three other such stores to stay open, including the one that had attracted international attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters followup&quot;/&gt; The operators of that store had applied for a reseller license from Apple.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters followup&quot;/&gt; At the time of the report, only four legitimate Apple Stores had opened in China, with two in Beijing and two in Shanghai.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fake clerk&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Apple Newton and iPhone.jpg|thumb|The Apple Newton MessagePad 2100, running Newton OS, alongside an iPhone running [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], Apple's current handheld platform.]]

The '''Newton platform''' was an early [[personal digital assistant]] and the first tablet [[platform (computing)|platform]] developed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], the second platform being [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], used in the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPad]]. Development{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} of the Newton platform started in 1987&lt;!-- See Apple confidential 2.0 by O. Linzmayer --&gt; and officially ended on February 27, 1998. Some electronic engineering and the manufacture of Apple's Newton devices was done by [[Motorola]]. Most Newton devices were based on the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] 610 RISC processor and all featured [[handwriting recognition]] software. Most Newton devices were developed and marketed by Apple (this includes the whole [[MessagePad]] line and the [[eMate 300]]), but other companies &amp;mdash; [[Motorola]], Sharp, and [[Digital Ocean]] &amp;mdash; also released devices that ran the [[Newton OS]].

[[File:Newton Lewt (2200371795).jpg|thumb|right|Three Newton MessagePad devices with keyboard and LinearFlash PCMCIA memory card accessories.]]

== Development ==
The Newton project was a PDA platform. The PDA category did not exist for most of Newton's genesis, and the phrase &quot;[[personal digital assistant]]&quot; was coined relatively late in the development cycle by Apple's CEO [[John Sculley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/john-sculley-newton-origin.html The Story Behind Apple's Newton], Tom Hormby - 2006.02.07, Low End Mac&lt;/ref&gt; the driving force behind the project. [[Larry Tesler]] identified that a powerful, low-power processor was needed for sophisticated graphics manipulation. He found [[Hermann Hauser]], with the [[Acorn RISC Machine]] processor, and put together [[Advanced RISC Machines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;macobserver john sculley 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/john_sculley_the_full_transcript_part2/ | title=John Sculley: The Truth About Me, Apple, and Steve Jobs Part 2 | work=The Mac Observer | date=January 13, 2012 | accessdate=January 20, 2012 | author=Kuehl Julie | author2=Martellaro, John | author3=Greelish, David | quote=[...] Larry [Tesler] realized that if you’re going to do very sophisticated graphics manipulation on a handheld product, that no processor existed at that time that was both powerful and low powered enough to be able to even attempt that. Larry Tesler found a man in the UK named Hermann Hauser who had founded the Acorn computer company. [...] a new company that we had to put together that was 47 percent owned by Apple, it was 47 percent owned by Olivetti, a name from the past, and the rest of it was owned by Hermann Hauser. And this company we called ARM.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton was intended to be a complete reinvention of personal computing.  For most of its design lifecycle Newton had a large-format screen, more internal memory, and an object-oriented graphics kernel. One of the original motivating [[use case]]s for the design was known as the &quot;Architect Scenario&quot;, in which Newton's designers imagined a residential [[architect]] working quickly with a client to sketch, clean up, and interactively modify a simple two-dimensional home plan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

There is, however, an extensive history of [[pen computing]] that predates the Newton, though not generally in the form factor of what would now be called a PDA.

For a portion of the Newton's development cycle (roughly the middle third&lt;!--exact dates?--&gt;), the project's intended programming language was [[Dylan programming language|Dylan]] though in fact the language and environment never matured enough for any applications to be successfully written.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Dylan was a small, efficient [[object-oriented]] [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] variant that still retains some interest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Although it was efficient (for its day, and considering its substantial run-time [[dynamic programming language|dynamism]]),{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Dylan never lived up to its developers' performance expectations and was a tough sell for a development team unaccustomed to Lisp programming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} When the move was made to a smaller form factor (designed by [[Jonathan Ive]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_39/b4002414.htm &quot;Who Is Jonathan Ive?&quot;], BusinessWeek&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/digital/cyberelite/44.html &quot;cyber elite: Jonathan Ive&quot;], Time&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan was relegated to experimental status in the &quot;Bauhaus Project&quot; and eventually canceled outright. Its replacement, [[NewtonScript]], had garbage collection and tight integration with the &quot;soup&quot; storage and user-interface toolkit, and was specifically designed to run in small RAM/large ROM environments. It was mostly developed by Walter Smith from 1992 to 1993.

The project missed its original goals to reinvent personal computing,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and then to [[Rewrite (programming)|rewrite]] contemporary application programming.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The Newton project fell victim to project slippage, [[scope creep]], and a growing fear that it would interfere with Macintosh sales. It was reinvented as a PDA platform which would be a complementary Macintosh peripheral instead of a stand-alone computer which might compete with the Macintosh.

Although [[PDA]]s had been developing since the original [[Psion Organiser]] in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/aSGuest22971-219207-pda-enter-tags-rohith-girish-shyamprasad-entertainment-ppt-powerpoint/ ISAS seminar on PDAs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PDA history blog&quot;&gt;[http://www.bloggersbase.com/gadgets-and-Mobile/history-of-pdas-part-1/ History of PDAs blog]&lt;/ref&gt; the Newton has left one particular lasting impression: the term ''personal digital assistant'' was first coined to refer to the Newton.&lt;ref name=&quot;PDA history blog&quot;/&gt;

John Sculley says Apple invested approximately US$100M to develop Newton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/2008-7351-5085423.html Riding the next technology wave], By Dawn Kawamoto, October 2, 2003, [[Cnet]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application software ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Controlpanelnewton.png|thumb|right|''The [[Newton OS]] GUI'']] --&gt;
Most Newton devices were pre-loaded with a variety of software to help in personal data organization and management.  This included such applications as Notes, Names, and Dates, as well as a variety of productivity tools such as a calculator, conversion calculators (metric conversions, currency conversions, etc), time-zone maps, etc.  In later/2.x versions of the [[Newton OS]] these applications were refined, and new ones were added, such as the Works word processor and the Newton Internet Enabler, as well as the inclusion of bundled [[Third-party developer|3rd party]] applications, such as the QuickFigure Works spreadsheet (a &quot;lite&quot; version of Pelicanware's QuickFigure Pro), Pocket [[Quicken]], the NetHopper web browser, and the EnRoute email client.  Various Newton applications had full import/export capabilities with popular desktop office suite and [[Personal information manager|PIM (Personal Information Manager)]] application file formats, primarily by making use of Apple's bundled [[Apple Newton Software|Newton Connection Utilities]] and also the Newton Connection Kit, which was sold separately and only worked for Newton devices that used the 1.x versions of the Newton OS.

====Notes====
The Notes application allowed users to create small documents that could contain text that had been typed, or that had been recognized from handwriting, as well as free-hand sketches, [[Apple Newton#User interface|&quot;Shapes&quot;, and &quot;ink text&quot;]].

[[Image:Apple newton messagepad checklist jk.jpg|left|thumbnail|Photograph of screen displaying Checklist, some bullet points [[Tick (checkmark)|checked]] and/or &quot;collapsed&quot;]] In version 2.0 of the [[Newton OS]], the Notes application (as well as Names) could accept what Apple termed &quot;stationery&quot;, 3rd-party created plug-in modules that could extend the functionality of the basic applications.

One of the new types of Notes stationery added to Newton OS 2.0 was a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]], [[Bullet point|bullet-ed]], collapsible, multi-line &quot;[[Checklist]]&quot;, an implementation of [[outliner]] software.  This could be used for organizing thoughts, priorities, [[Time management|&quot;to do&quot; lists]], planning steps and sub-tasks, etc.  Each bullet point could contain as many lines of text as desired.  A bullet point could be dragged and placed underneath another bullet point, thus forming a hierarchical [[outline]]/[[Tree structure|tree]].  When a bullet point was dragged, the entire sub-[[Tree structure|tree]] of child bullet points underneath it (if any) would be dragged along as well.  If a bullet point had child bullet points, tapping the hollow parent bullet point once would &quot;roll up&quot; or collapse all the children ([[WindowShade|&quot;windowshade&quot; effect]]).  The parent bullet point would become a solid black circle and all the children would disappear.  Tapping the parent bullet point again would make the children re-appear. Because this functionality arrived in Newton OS 2.0, several third parties made similar software before for OS 1.x Newton machines, the most notable of which was Dyno Notepad, released in 1993.

====Names====
The Names application was used for storing contacts. Contacts created either on the Newton device or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop [[Personal information manager|PIM]] could be synchronized to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Apple Computer. [http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=38006 &quot;Newton Connection Utilities ReadMe&quot;], Apple, July 24, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apple Computer. [http://www.oldschool.net/newton/papers/ncu.html#NCU &quot;Newton Connection Utilities Features&quot;], Newton Source&lt;/ref&gt;  Entering a date in Names for fields such as birthday or anniversary automatically created corresponding repeating events in the Dates application.  Each contact had an attached free-form notes field available to it, that could contain any mix of interleaved text, ink text, Shapes, or Sketches.  Like Notes, Names could be extended by developers, to create special new categories of contacts with specialized pre-defined fields.  Names shipped with 3 types of contacts, &quot;people&quot;, &quot;companies&quot;, and &quot;groups&quot;, but a developer could define new types, for instance &quot;client&quot;, &quot;patient&quot;, etc. [http://standalone.com/ Stand Alone Software, Inc.] also created a Newton software package called the Stationery Construction Kit, which allowed users to make stationery themselves without aid of any other tools.

====Dates====
Dates supplied calendar, events, meeting, and alarms functions, including an integrated [[Time management|&quot;to do&quot; list]] manager.  It offered many different display and navigation styles, including a list view, graphical day &quot;time blocking&quot; view, or a week, month, or year grid.  As with Names and Notes, Dates items created either on the Newton or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop [[Personal information manager|PIM]] could be synchronized to each other.

=== Operating system and programming environment ===
The [[Newton OS]] consists of three layers. At the lowest level, a [[microkernel]] handles resources like [[Task (computers)|tasks]] and memory. On top of the microkernel, the bulk of the operating system is implemented in [[C++]], including the communications layer, handwriting recognition, and the [[NewtonScript]] environment. The top layer consists of built-in and user installed applications written in NewtonScript.

NewtonScript is an advanced [[object-oriented programming]] language, developed by Apple employee [[Walter Smith (programmer)|Walter Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://waltersmith.us/ Walter Smith’s home page]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some programmers complained at the $1000 cost of the Toolbox programming environment. Additionally, it required learning a new way of programming.

The Newton Toolkit (NTK), an integrated environment tailored to the graphical nature of the Newton platform, was developed specifically for developing applications for the Newton platform and included a graphical view editor, a template browser, and an interactive inspector window for debugging. Initially, it was only available for [[Macintosh]] computers, and later a [[Microsoft Windows]] version was developed. The Technical Lead for the Newton Toolkit was Norberto Menendez; other engineers on the team were Ben Sharpe and Peter Potrebic.

=== Data storage ===
Data in Newton is stored in object-oriented databases known as [[Soup (Apple Newton)|soups]]. One of the innovative aspects of Newton is that soups are available to all programs; and programs can operate cross-soup; meaning that the calendar can refer to names in the address book; a note in the notepad can be converted to an appointment, and so forth; and the soups can be programmer-extended&amp;mdash;a new address book enhancement can be built on the data from the existing address book. The soup system also made it easy to synchronize data, and the Newton Connection tools could be used for importing and exporting data. Among many file formats are the [[Rich Text Format]], Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Works, and many more.

Another consequence of the data-object soup is that objects can extend built-in applications such as the address book so seamlessly that Newton users can sometimes not distinguish which program or add-on object is responsible for the various features on their own system, because the advanced nature of Newton devices makes it easy to accept such add-ons. A user rebuilding their system after extended usage might find themselves unable to manually restore their system to the same functionality because some long-forgotten downloaded extension was missing. Data owned and used by applications and extensions themselves is tossed in the &quot;Storage&quot; area of the &quot;Extras&quot; drawer in 2.x Newton devices; on 1.x systems, they can only be found or removed in the Memory section of the built-in Prefs application, in the Card slip (also built-in), or with third-party tools such as NewtCase. There is no built-in distinction between types of data in that area. For example, an installed application's icon could be sitting right next to a database of addresses used by another installed extension further down the list.

Finally, the data soup concept works well for data like addresses, which benefit from being shared cross-functionally, but it works poorly for discrete data sets like files and documents. Later, the 2.0 release of the [[Newton OS]] introduced Virtual Binary Objects to alleviate the problem of handling large data objects.

===Package installation, capacity planning, and disaster recovery===
Several software utilities which accommodate data transfer to and from a host system exist for the following platforms:

* Mac OS
* Mac OS X
* [[UNIX]]
* [[Linux]]
* [[Microsoft Windows]]

===In the Media===
The MessagePad featured in an August 1993 instalment of [[Garry Trudeau]]'s popular political cartoon [[Doonesbury]], where its handwriting recognition was mocked. The final panel of the strip showed the Newton producing the text &quot;egg freckles&quot; in response to input. This phrase was subsequently included as a trigger for an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] in later editions of the MessagePad, producing a panel from the strip when it was entered on the device. Apple subsequently donated a MessagePad to Trudeau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/18/business/doonesbury-and-apple-hatch-a-comic-surprise.html Doonesbury' and Apple Hatch a Comic Surprise], By JOHN MARKOFF, Published: December 18, 1995, New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Simpsons]] features the Newton during the episode [[Lisa on Ice]], where school bully [[List_of_recurring_characters_in_The_Simpsons#Dolph_Starbeam|Dolph]] makes a memo on the device to &quot;Beat up [[Martin Prince|Martin]]&quot;, which the handwriting recognition software mistranslates to &quot;Eat Up Martha&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuaw.com/2006/02/16/eat-up-martha/ Eat Up Martha], by Dave Caolo, Feb 16th 2006,TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/ref&gt;

== Newton technology after cancellation ==
Before the Newton project was canceled, it was &quot;spun off&quot; into an Apple wholly owned subsidiary  company, ''Newton Inc.'', but was reabsorbed several months later when Apple CEO [[Gil Amelio]] was fired by the board and  [[Steve Jobs]] took over as then interim CEO. Two ex-Apple Newton developers founded [[Pixo]], the company that created the operating system for the original [[iPod]].

Speculation continued for several years that Apple might release a new PDA with some Newton technology or collaborate with Palm. Feeding a bit of speculation, Apple put the &quot;Print Recognizer&quot; part of the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition system into [[Mac OS X]] version 10.2 (known as &quot;Jaguar&quot;). It can be used with graphics tablets to seamlessly input handwritten printed text anywhere there was an insertion point on the screen. This technology, known as &quot;[[Inkwell (Macintosh)|Inkwell]]&quot;, appears in the System Preferences whenever a tablet input device is plugged in. An [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] in Print Recognizer on the Newton (write &quot;ROSETTA! ROSETTA! ROSETTA!&quot;, and the Newton will insert &quot;ROSETTA! ROSETTA! Hey, that's me!&quot; instead) was present in Inkwell in Mac OS 10.2 and 10.3, but seems to have been removed in 10.4. Larry Yaeger was the author of the original Rosetta recognizer on the Newton, and was also responsible for porting it to Mac OS X.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwnc.newtontalk.net/2004/program/larryyaeger/slides-larryyaeger.pdf Handwriting Recognition Technology in the Newton's Second Generation “Print Recognizer”(The One That Worked)], By Larry Yaeger - Apple Computer , World Wide Newton Conference, September 4-5, 2004, Slides&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]] name was later used for Apple's [[PowerPC]] software translation layer for [[Intel]]-based Macs.

Some of the handwriting recognition technology from the Newton later found its way into Windows CE.  The letter preferences menus showing the different ways that people write cursive characters were pixel identical on Windows CE to those previously used on the MessagePad.

At an All Things Digital conference in 2004, Steve Jobs made reference to a new &quot;Apple PDA&quot; (perhaps a successor to the Newton) which the company had developed but had decided not to bring to market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/04/06/07/jobs_apple_developed_but_did_not_ship_apple_pda.html Jobs: Apple developed, but did not ship Apple PDA], By Kasper Jade, June 7, 2004, AppleInsider&lt;/ref&gt;  The tablet eventually evolved into the iOS product family{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.

=== Newton emulation ===
Since 2004, the Einstein Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/einstein/ Open Einstein Project]&lt;/ref&gt; has been working on emulating the Newton for use as an alternate OS on other platforms. It is currently available for the Sharp [[Zaurus]], Apple's [[Mac OS X]], Nokia [[Nokia 770|770]] and [[Nokia N800|N800]], [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[Pepper Pad|PepperPad]] 3. The emulator is an open source project, but requires an original Newton ROM to be installed in order to function. Since September 2010, Einstein also runs on iPhones, iPads, and the Android operating system since March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myapplenewton.blogspot.com/2011/03/apple-newton-on-android.html Apple Newton on Android], March 13, 2011, My Apple Newton&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future===
A possible Newton revival was at one time a common source of speculation among the Macintosh user base; when patents for a tablet based Macintosh were applied for,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=600 Appleinsider, ''Euro filing reveals Apple handheld design images'', August 13, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; rumor sites jumped at the possibility of a new [[Tablet computer|tablet PC]]-style Macintosh.

In September 2009, [[Michael Tchao]], one of the Newton's marketing product champions, returned to Apple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/28/apple-rehires-newton-and-nike-marketing-whiz/ ''Apple Rehires a Developer of Its Newton Tablet'',September 28, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Programs have been written for the Newton since its cancellation. New functions include: reading ebooks, reading RSS feeds, and writing [[spreadsheets]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The '''Apple III''' (often rendered as '''Apple ///''') is a business-oriented personal computer produced and released by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] that was intended as the successor to the [[Apple II series]], but largely considered a failure in the market. Development work on the Apple III started in late 1978 under the guidance of Dr. Wendell Sander. It had the internal code name of &quot;Sara&quot;, named after Sander's daughter.
&lt;ref name = &quot;sara&quot;&gt;[http://lowendmac.com/orchard/05/apple-iii-lisa-era.html Two Apple Failures: Apple III and Lisa]{{Verify credibility|date=April 2010}}&lt;!-- Source uses this Wikipedia itself as a source --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=April 2010}} The machine was first announced and released on May 19, 1980, but due to serious stability issues that required a design overhaul and a recall of existing machines, it was formally reintroduced the following autumn.&lt;ref name = &quot;intro&quot;&gt;[http://oldcomputers.net/appleiii.html Apple III computer @ oldcomputers.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Development stopped and the Apple III was discontinued on April 24, 1984, and the III Plus was dropped from the Apple product line in September 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;apconf&quot;/&gt;

The Apple III could be viewed as an enhanced Apple II – then the newest heir to a line of [[8-bit]] machines dating back to 1976. Officially, however, the Apple III was not part of the Apple II line, but rather a close cousin. The key features business users wanted in a personal computer were a true typewriter-style upper/lowercase keyboard (as opposed to the Apple II which was based on a teletype keyboard) and 80 column display. In addition the machine has to pass FCC qualifications for RFI (Radio Frequency Interference). In 1981, [[International Business Machines]] unveiled the [[IBM Personal Computer]] (IBM PC) – a completely new [[16-bit]] design soon available in a wide range of inexpensive clones. The business market moved rapidly towards the [[PC-DOS]]/[[MS-DOS]] platform, eventually pulling away from the Apple 8-bit computer line.&lt;ref name = &quot;IBMPC&quot;&gt;[http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/ibm-pc-5150-origin.html The Origin of the IBM PC]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite numerous stability issues and recalls, Apple was eventually able to produce a reliable and dependable version of the machine. However, damage to the computer's reputation had already been done and it failed to do well commercially as a direct result. In the end, an estimated 65,000–75,000 Apple III computers were sold.&lt;ref name = &quot;intro&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;apconf&quot;/&gt; The Apple III Plus brought this up to ~120,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;apconf&quot;/&gt; Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] stated that the primary reason for the Apple III's failure was that the system was designed by Apple's marketing department, unlike Apple's previous engineering-driven projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;iwoz&quot;&gt;[[Steve Wozniak|Wozniak, S. G.]] (2006), ''iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It''. [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]. ISBN 0-393-06143-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple III's failure led to Apple reevaluating their plan to phase out the Apple II and eventually continued on with its development. As a result, later Apple II models incorporated some hardware, such as the Stylewriter thermal printer, and software technologies of the Apple III.
{{Timeline of Apple II Family|headerextension==}}

==Apple III design==
The Apple III was designed to be a business computer and an eventual successor for the Apple II. While the Apple II contributed to the inspirations of several important business products, such as [[VisiCalc]], [[Multiplan]] and [[Apple Writer]], the computer's hardware architecture, [[operating system]] and developer environment were limited.&lt;ref name = &quot;apple2hist&quot;&gt;[http://apple2history.org/history/ah07.html The Apple III Project]&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple III addressed these weaknesses.

The Apple III was powered by a 1.8 [[megahertz|MHz]] SynerTek 6502A or B&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Panic?|url=http://www.6502lane.net/2010/07/27/apple-panic-oh-yes/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[8-bit]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] and, like some of the more advanced machines in the Apple II family, used [[bank switching]] techniques to address up to 256 KB of memory. Third-party vendors also produced memory upgrade kits that allowed the Apple III to reach up to 512 KB. Other Apple III built-in features included an 80-column display with upper and lowercase characters, a numeric keypad, dual-speed (pressure sensitive) cursor control keys, 6-bit (DAC) audio, 16-color high-resolution graphics, and a built-in 140 KB 5.25&quot; [[floppy disk]] drive. Unlike the Apple II, the Disk III controller was built into the logic board.

The Apple III was the first Apple product that allowed the user to choose both a screen font and a keyboard layout: either [[QWERTY]] or [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]]. These choices could not be changed while programs were running, unlike the [[Apple IIc]], which had a keyboard switch directly above the keyboard, allowing switching on the fly.

==Software==
A major limitation of the Apple II and DOS 3.3 was the way it addressed resources, which made it highly desirable for [[peripherals]] to be installed in standardized locations (slot 5 and 6 reserved for storage devices, slot 2 reserved for serial communication interfaces, etc.) This forced the user to identify a peripheral by its physical location, such as PR#6, CATALOG,D1, and so on.&lt;ref name=&quot;beneathdos&quot;&gt;Beneath Apple DOS, Chapter 6 ''Using DOS from Assembly Language''&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple III introduced an advanced operating system called '''[[Apple SOS]]''', pronounced &quot;apple sauce&quot;. Its ability to address resources by name instead of a physical location allowed the Apple III to be more scalable. Apple SOS also allowed the full capacity of a storage device to be used as a single volume, such as the [[Apple ProFile]] hard disk drive. Also, Apple SOS supported a hierarchical file system (HFS). Some of the features and code base of Apple SOS made their way into the Apple II's [[ProDOS]] and [[GS/OS]] operating systems, as well as [[Apple Lisa|Lisa 7/7]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh system software]].

The Apple III also introduced a new [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] called [[Business BASIC|Apple III Business BASIC]], and later an implementation of [[UCSD Pascal]] for more [[structured programming]].

Originally intended as a direct replacement to the Apple II series, it was designed for backwards-compatibility of Apple II software in order to migrate users over. However, since Apple did not want to encourage continued development of the II platform, Apple II compatibility on the Apple III existed only in a special &quot;Apple II Mode&quot; which was limited in its capabilities to the emulation of a basic 48 KB Apple II+ configuration, with no access to the III's advanced features such as its larger memory, a restriction which actually required custom chips to enforce. Since many business-oriented Apple II programs started requiring at least 64 KB of RAM (i.e. an 48 KB Apple II with an added 16 KB &quot;language card&quot;) around the time the III was released, they were incompatible with the III, preventing some users from switching over.

The Apple III had a System Utilities program, which allowed system reconfiguration and file manipulation. Another program, Selector III, was designed to integrate with the System Utilities program and launch various applications. The program was developed by ON THREE, a large Apple III user group.  Another company, [[Quark, Inc.|Quark Software]], developed a competing product, Catalyst, the cruder interface of which was offset by program-switching capabilities and support for copy-protection, which enabled companies to license users to run programs from a hard disk without worrying that their software might be backed up or copied without permission. When Apple decided to bundle Catalyst with its new [[ProFile]] hard disk, Quark celebrated, but ON THREE continued to market and sell Selector III through their monthly magazine.  Selector III remained commercially available and supported long after Quark discontinued its Apple III product line.

==Peripherals==
Several new Apple-produced peripherals were developed for the Apple III. The original Apple III came with a built-in real-time clock, which was recognized by Apple SOS. The clock was later removed from the &quot;revised&quot; model, and instead was made available as an add-on.

Along with the built-in floppy drive, the Apple III could also handle up to three additional external '''Disk III''' floppy disk drives. The [[Disk II#Disk III|Disk III]] was only officially compatible with the Apple III, although the Apple III was able to use the Apple II's modified [[Disk II]] disk drive and vice-versa.

With the introduction of the revised Apple III a year after launch Apple began offering the [[ProFile]] external hard disk system.&lt;ref name = &quot;bott&quot; /&gt; Costing US$3499 for 5MB, it also required a peripheral slot for the ProFile controller card.

==Revisions==
[[File:Apple III+.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Apple III Plus]]
Once the logic board design flaws were discovered, a newer logic board design was produced – which included a lower power requirement, wider traces and better designed chip sockets.&lt;ref name = &quot;bott&quot;&gt;[http://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/computers/III.html Apple III @ bott.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The $3,495 revised model also included 256 KB RAM as a standard configuration.&lt;ref name = &quot;bott&quot; /&gt; The 14,000 units of the original Apple III sold were returned and replaced with the entirely new revised model.

===Apple III Plus===
The '''Apple III Plus''' was introduced in December 1983, while discontinuing the revised III model, at a price of US$2995.&lt;ref name=&quot;bott&quot; /&gt; This newer version included a built-in clock, video interlacing, standardized rear port connectors, 256K RAM as standard, and a re-designed keyboard. The keyboard was designed in the style of the earlier beige [[Apple IIe]].&lt;ref name = &quot;bott&quot; /&gt;

Owners of the earlier Apple III could obtain the newer logic board as a service replacement. A keyboard upgrade kit, dubbed &quot;Apple III Plus upgrade kit&quot; was also made available – which included the keyboard, cover, keyboard encoder ROM and logo replacements. This upgrade had to be installed by an authorized service technician.

==Design flaws==
[[Steve Jobs]] insisted on the idea of no fan or air vents – in order to make the computer run quietly. Jobs would later push this same ideology onto almost all Apple models he had control of – from the [[Apple Lisa]] and [[Macintosh 128K]] to the [[iMac]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://onscreen-scientist.com/?tag=fan-control First Cool, Now Quiet]&lt;/ref&gt; To allow the computer to dissipate heat, the base of the Apple III was made of heavy cast aluminum, which supposedly acted as a heat sink. One undeniable advantage to the aluminum case was less RFI (Radio Frequency Interference), a problem which plagued the Apple II series throughout its history. Unlike the Apple II series, the power supply was stored – without its own shell – in a compartment separate from the logic board.
The decision to use an aluminum shell ultimately led to engineering issues which resulted in the Apple III's reliability problems. The lead time for manufacturing the shells was high and had to be done before the motherboard was finalized. Later it was realized that there wasn't enough room on the motherboard for all of the components unless narrow traces were used.
[[File:Apple III+ case.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Apple III Plus showing the heatsink and the cast aluminum case]]
However, many Apple III's experienced heating issues, allegedly caused by insufficient cooling and inability to dissipate the heat efficiently. To address the heat problem, later Apple III's were fitted with heat sinks. But still, the case design made it impossible for enough heat to escape. Some users stated that their Apple III became so hot that the chips started dislodging from the board, the screen would display garbled data, or their [[Floppy disk|disk]] would come out of the slot &quot;melted&quot;. In a technical bulletin, customers who were experiencing certain problems were instructed to lift the machine {{convert|3|in|mm}} and drop it in order to re-seat the chips on the logic board.&lt;ref name=&quot;apconf&quot;/&gt; [[Jerry Manock]], the case designer, refuted these case design flaw charges and maintained that the unit adequately dissipated the internal heat, which he proved with various tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--7Br07QKMk Computer History Museum: Apple Industrial Designers Robert Brunner and Jerry Manock]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, Manock was vindicated, as the primary culprit turned out to be a major logic board design problem. The logic board used &quot;fineline&quot; technology that was not fully mature at the time, with narrow, closely spaced traces.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;/&gt; When chips were &quot;stuffed&quot; into the board and [[Wave soldering|wave-soldered]], solder bridges would form between traces that were not supposed to be connected. This caused numerous short circuits, which required hours of costly diagnosis and hand rework to fix. Apple designed a new circuit board – with more layers and normal-width traces. The new logic board was designed by one designer on a huge drafting board, rather than a costly [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]-[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] system used for the previous board, and it worked. With normal-width traces there wasn't enough room for all of the components so a separate daughterboard had to be designed for the RAM which would fit within the existing heatsink.

Earlier Apple III units came with a built-in real time clock, manufactured by [[National Semiconductor]]. The hardware, however, would fail after prolonged use. While it was assumed that a vendor would test parts before shipping them, Apple did not perform this level of testing. Apple was soldering chips directly to boards and could not easily change out a bad chip if one was found. Eventually, Apple solved this problem by removing the real-time clock from the Apple III's specification, rather than shipping the Apple III with the clock pre-installed, and sold the peripheral as a level 1 technician add-on.&lt;ref name=&quot;apconf&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Apple Confidential 2.0: The Definitive History of the World's Most Colorful Company|first=Owen W.|last=Linzmayer|isbn=1593270100|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mXnw5tM8QRwC&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;pg=PA41|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial failure==
For a variety of reasons, the Apple III was a commercial failure. With a starting price between $4,340 to $7,800 US, it was more expensive than many of the [[CP/M]]-based business computers that were available at the time.&lt;ref name = &quot;avuqmb&quot;/&gt; The Apple III's software library was very limited, and while sold as Apple II compatible, the emulation that made this possible was intentionally hobbled; thus it could not make use of the advanced III features (specifically 64 KB RAM or higher, required by a large number of Apple II software titles based on PASCAL), which limited its usefulness.

Early Apple III users were told that they had to use existing 40-column Apple II word processors and spreadsheet programs, which hurt sales since those programs could be used in 80-column mode on the Apple IIs with the suitable hardware installed. It wasn't until several months after the Apple III was introduced that native 80-column business software became available.

==Influence==
The [[filesystem]] and some design ideas from [[Apple SOS]], the Apple III's operating system, were part of [[Apple ProDOS]] and [[Apple GS/OS]], the major operating systems for the [[Apple II series]] following the demise of the Apple III. This hierarchical file system influenced the evolution of the Macintosh: while the original Macintosh File System (MFS) was a flat file system without subdirectories, subsequent file systems were hierarchical. Curiously, The [[IBM PC]]'s first file system (designed for floppy disks) was flat; later versions (designed for hard disks) were hierarchical.

The '''Apple Lisa'''—also known as the '''Lisa'''—is a [[:personal computer]] designed by [[Apple Computer, Inc.]] (now Apple, Inc.) during the early 1980s.

Development of the Lisa began in 1978&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mac-history.net/apple-lisa/2007-10-12/apple-lisa&lt;/ref&gt; as a powerful personal computer with a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) targeted toward business customers.

In 1982, [[Steve Jobs]] was forced out of the Lisa project,&lt;ref&gt;From the book ''iCon: Steve Jobs, The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business''&lt;/ref&gt; so he joined the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] project instead. The Macintosh is not a direct descendant of Lisa, although there are obvious similarities between the systems and the final revision, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the [[Macintosh XL]].

The Lisa was a more advanced system than the Macintosh of that time in many respects, such as its inclusion of [[protected memory]], [[cooperative multitasking]], a generally more sophisticated hard disk based [[operating system]], a built-in [[screensaver]], an advanced calculator with a paper tape and [[Reverse polish|RPN]], support for up to two&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte]]s (MB) of [[RAM]], expansion slots, a numeric keypad, data corruption protection schemes such as block sparing, non-physical file names (with the ability to have multiple documents with the same name), and a larger higher-resolution display. It would be many years before many of those features were implemented on the Macintosh platform. [[memory protection|Protected memory]], for instance, did not arrive until the [[Mac OS X]] operating system was released in 2001. The Macintosh featured a faster [[Motorola 68000|68000]] [[microprocessor|processor]] (7.89&amp;nbsp;MHz) and sound. The complexity of the Lisa operating system and its programs taxed the 5&amp;nbsp;MHz Motorola 68000 microprocessor so that consumers said it felt sluggish, particularly when scrolling in documents.

==Etymology==
While the documentation shipped with the original Lisa only ever referred to it as ''The Lisa'', officially, Apple stated that the name was an [[acronym]] for '''L'''ocal '''I'''ntegrated '''S'''oftware '''A'''rchitecture or &quot;LISA&quot;. Since Steve Jobs' first daughter (born in 1978) was named [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa Nicole Brennan]], it is normally inferred that the name also had a personal association, and perhaps that the acronym was invented later to fit the name. [[Andy Hertzfeld]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Andy Hertzfeld]] |title=Revolution in the Valley |year=2005 | publisher=O'Reilly |isbn=0596007191 |chapter=Bicycle |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the acronym was [[backronym|reverse engineered]] from the name &quot;Lisa&quot; in autumn 1982 by the Apple marketing team, after they had hired a marketing consultancy firm to come up with names to replace &quot;Lisa&quot; and &quot;Macintosh&quot; (at the time considered by [[Rod Holt]], vice president of engineering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theapplemuseum.com/index.php?id=52]&lt;/ref&gt; to be merely internal project codenames) and then rejected all of the suggestions. Privately, Hertzfeld and the other software developers used &quot;Lisa: Invented Stupid Acronym&quot;, a [[recursive acronym|recursive]] [[backronym]], while computer industry [[Pundit (expert)|pundits]] coined the term &quot;Let's Invent Some Acronym&quot; to fit the Lisa's name. Decades later, Jobs would tell his biographer [[Walter Isaacson]]: &quot;Obviously it was named for my daughter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=Steve Jobs|year=2011|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=9781451648539|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The project began in 1978 as an effort to create a more modern version of the then-conventional design epitomized by the [[Apple II]]. Initial team lead Ken Rothmuller was soon replaced by [[John Couch (American executive)|John Couch]], under whose direction the project evolved to the 'windows &amp; mouse-driven' form that was finally released. [[Trip Hawkins]], who was then on the marketing team for the nascent Lisa project, and [[Jef Raskin]] contributed to the change in design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lowendmac.com/orchard/05/apple-lisa-history.html A History of Apple's Lisa, 1979–1986]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years prior to this, research had been going on at Xerox's [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto Research Center]] to create a new way to organize everything on the screen, today known as the [[Desktop computer|desktop]].
Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC in 1979. He was excited by the revolutionary mouse-driven GUI of the [[Xerox Alto]] and was keen to use these ideas back at Apple. By late 1979, Jobs successfully negotiated with Xerox for his Lisa team to receive two demonstrations of ongoing research projects at Xerox PARC; when the Apple team saw the demonstration of the [[Xerox Alto|Alto]] computer they were able to see in action the basic elements of what constituted a workable GUI. A great deal of work was put into making the graphical interface into a mainstream commercial product by the Lisa team.

The Lisa was a major project at Apple, with more than 90 people participating on the design, plus more on the sales and marketing effort to launch the machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;byte83&quot;&gt;[http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2008/05/29/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-development-of-apples-lisa/ &quot;An Interview with Wayne Rosing, Bruce Daniels, and Larry Tesler: A behind the scenes look at the development of Apple's Lisa,&quot;] ''Byte,'' February 1983, p.90+&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Byte (magazine)|''Byte'']] magazine credited [[Wayne Rosing]] with being the most important person on the development of the computer's hardware until the machine went into production, at which point he became technical lead for the entire Lisa project. [[Bruce Daniels]] was in charge of applications development, and [[Larry Tesler]] was in charge of system software.&lt;ref name=&quot;byte83&quot;/&gt; After a six-month period in which the user interface was designed, the hardware, operating system, and applications were all created in parallel.

==Hardware==
The hardware development team for the Lisa was headed by [http://www.linkedin.com/in/rparatore Robert Paratore].
The Lisa was first introduced on January 19, 1983 and cost US$9,995 ($21,693.67 in 2009 dollars). It was the second personal computer system with a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) to be sold commercially, the first being the [[Xerox Star]]. It used a [[Motorola 68000]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] at a 5&amp;nbsp;[[Megahertz#Megahertz in computing|MHz]] clock rate and had 1&amp;nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]. 

===Drives===
The original Lisa had two [[Apple FileWare]] 5.25-inch double-sided [[floppy disk|floppy disk drives]], more commonly known by Apple's internal code name for the drive: &quot;[[Apple FileWare|Twiggy]]&quot;. They had a capacity of approximately 871&amp;nbsp;kB each, but required special diskettes. The Macintosh, which was originally designed to have a single Twiggy drive, was revised to use a Sony 400&amp;nbsp;kB microfloppy drive in January 1984. An optional external 5&amp;nbsp;MB or, later, a 10&amp;nbsp;MB [[Apple ProFile]] [[hard drive]] (originally designed for the [[Apple III]]) was available. With the introduction of the Lisa 2, an optional 10&amp;nbsp;MB internal proprietary hard disk manufactured by Apple, known as the &quot;[[Apple Widget|Widget]]&quot; was also offered.

===Lisa 2===
[[File:Apple Lisa2-IMG 1517.jpg|thumb|Lisa 2]]
The first hardware revision, the '''Lisa 2''', released in January 1984 and was priced between $3,495 and $5,495 US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://macgui.com/usenet/?group=6&amp;id=278 Re: MACINTOSH opinion and request]&lt;/ref&gt; It was much less expensive than the original model and dropped the Twiggy floppy drives in favor of a single [[Macintosh External Disk Drive#400K|400k Sony microfloppy]]. It was possible to purchase the Lisa 2 with as little as 512k RAM. An external ProFile and internal Widget drive were available as standard options in different configurations. In 1984, at the same time the Macintosh was officially announced, Apple offered free upgrades to the Lisa 2 to all Lisa 1 owners, by swapping the pair of Twiggy drives for a single 3.5-inch drive, and updating the boot ROM and I/O ROM. In addition, the Lisa 2's new front faceplate was included to accommodate the reconfigured floppy disk drive. With this change, the Lisa 2 had the notable distinction of introducing the new Apple inlaid logo, as well as the first [[Snow White design language]] features.

There were relatively few third-party hardware offerings for the Lisa, as compared to the earlier [[Apple II]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} AST offered a 1.5&amp;nbsp;MB memory board, which&amp;nbsp;— when combined with the standard Apple 512&amp;nbsp;KB memory board&amp;nbsp;— expanded the Lisa to a total of 2&amp;nbsp;MB of memory, the maximum the [[Memory management unit|MMU]] could address.

Late in the product life of the Lisa, there were third-party hard disk drives, SCSI controllers, and double-sided 3½ inch floppy-disk upgrades. Unlike the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]], the Lisa features expansion slots. Like the Apple II, it was an 'open system'. The Lisa 2 motherboard had a very basic [[backplane]] with virtually no electronic components, but plenty of [[edge connector]] sockets/slots. There were two RAM slots, one CPU slot and one I/O slot all in parallel placement to each other. At the other end, there were three 'Lisa' slots, parallel to each other. This flexibility provided the potential for a developer to create a replacement for the CPU 'card' to upgrade the Lisa to run a newer CPU, albeit with potential limitations from other parts of the system.

===Macintosh XL===
[[File:Macintosh XL 1.jpg|thumb|Macintosh XL]]
{{Main|Macintosh XL}}

In January 1985, following on the heels of the Macintosh, the Lisa 2/10 (with integrated 10&amp;nbsp;MB hard drive) was re-branded the '''Macintosh XL''' and with new software, positioned as Apple's high-end Macintosh. The price was lowered yet again, to $4000 and sales tripled, but (according to CEO Sculley) Apple would have lost money increasing production to meet the new demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 3, 1985|title=Apple's LISA meets a bad end|journal=InfoWorld|volume=7|issue=22| pages=21|issn=0199-6649}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple discontinued the Macintosh XL, leaving an eight-month void in Apple's high-end product line until the [[Macintosh Plus]] was introduced in 1986. Apple would not introduce a replacement computer with an internal hard drive or expansion slots until 1987.

==Software==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lisa OS]] --&gt;
[[File:Apple Lisa Office System 3.1.png|thumb|240px|A screen shot of the Lisa Office System 3.1]]

The Lisa [[operating system]] featured cooperative (non-preemptive) [[computer multitasking|multitasking]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~quynh/courses/cs520-sp07/presentations/Thunikii_mem_mgmt_MAC_OS.ppt Evolution of Memory Management in Mac OS]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[virtual memory]], then extremely advanced features for a personal computer. The use of virtual memory coupled with a fairly slow disk system made the system performance seem glacial at times. Based in part on advanced elements from the failed [[Apple III]] [[Apple SOS|SOS]] operating system released three years earlier, the Lisa also organized its files in hierarchal directories, making the use of large hard drives practical. The Macintosh would eventually adopt this disk organizational design as well for its [[Hierarchical File System|HFS]] filing system. Conceptually, the Lisa resembles the [[Xerox Star]] in the sense that it was envisioned as an office computing system; consequently, Lisa has two main user modes: the Lisa Office System and the Workshop. The Lisa Office System is the GUI environment for end users. The Workshop was a program development environment, and was almost entirely text-based, though it used a GUI text editor. The Lisa Office System was eventually renamed &quot;7/7&quot;, in reference to the seven supplied application programs: LisaWrite, LisaCalc, LisaDraw, LisaGraph, [[LisaProject]], LisaList, and LisaTerminal.

==Third-party software==
[[File:Apple Lisa Workshop.png|thumb|240px|A screen shot of the Apple Lisa Workshop]]
A significant impediment to third-party software on the Lisa was the fact that, when first launched, the Lisa Office System could not be used to write programs for itself: a separate development OS was required called Lisa Workshop. During this development process, an engineer ran the two OSes in a dual-boot config, writing and compiling code on one machine and testing it on the other. Later, the same Lisa Workshop was used to develop software for the Macintosh. After a few years, a Macintosh-native development system was developed. For most of its lifetime, the Lisa never went beyond the original seven applications that Apple had deemed enough to &quot;do everything.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===MacWorks===
{{Main|MacWorks}}

In April 1984, following the success of the Macintosh, Apple introduced '''MacWorks''', a software emulation environment which allowed the Lisa to run Macintosh System software and applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidebookgallery.org/articles/thelisa2applesablestcomputer GUIdebook &gt; Articles &gt; “The Lisa 2: Apple’s ablest computer”]&lt;/ref&gt; MacWorks helped make the Lisa more attractive to potential customers, but did not enable the Macintosh emulation to access the hard disk until September. In January 1985, re-branded '''MacWorks XL''', it became the primary system application designed to turn the Lisa into the [[Macintosh XL]].

==Reception==
[[File:Apple Computer, 1983 (Lisa).jpg|thumb|Apple Convention, Boston, Spring 1983. An original Apple Lisa at work.]]
The Apple Lisa was a commercial failure for Apple, the largest since the failure of the [[Apple III]] of 1980. The intended business customers were reluctant to purchase the machine because of its high price (nearly $10,000), making it largely unable to compete with the less expensive [[IBM PC]]s, which were already beginning to dominate business desktop computing. The largest Lisa customer was [[NASA]], which used [[LisaProject]] for project management and was eventually faced with significant problems when the Lisa was discontinued.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The release of the [[Macintosh 128K|Apple Macintosh]] in 1984, which was faster and much less expensive, was the most significant factor in the Lisa's demise. Two later Lisa models were released (the Lisa 2 and its [[Old World ROM|Mac ROM]]-enabled sibling [[Macintosh XL]]) before the Lisa line was discontinued in April 1985.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Back In Time&quot;, A+ Magazine, Feb 1987: 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Apple offered all Lisa/XL owners the opportunity to turn in their computer and US$1,498.00, in return for a [[Macintosh Plus]] and [[Hard Disk 20]] (a US$4,098.00 value at the time).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semaphorecorp.com/ss/ss26.html Signal 26, March 1986, circulation 45,013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical importance==

The Apple Lisa was immediately recognized as a significant machine, with ''Byte'' for example opining it more important than the [[IBM PC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2008/05/29/the-lisa-computer-system-apple-designs-a-new-kind-of-machine/ &quot;The Lisa Computer System&amp;nbsp;– Apple designs a new kind of machine,&quot;] Gregg Williams, ''Byte,'' February 1983, p.33+&lt;/ref&gt; Further, though a limited number of Lisas were sold, the Lisa software, in combination with an Apple dot-matrix printer, could produce documents that surpassed other comparably-priced options available at the time.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This one compelling usage meant that the Lisa was introduced into a number of larger offices, and due to the price, the number of people who had used a Lisa was much larger than the number of Lisas sold.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

An often-overlooked feature the Lisa system used is its early harnessing of document-centric{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} computing instead of application-centric computing. On a Macintosh, Windows, or Linux system, a user typically seeks a program. In the Lisa system, users use stationery to begin using an application. Apple implemented stationery documents on [[System 7]] in 1991 and attempted to further advance this approach on the Mac platform later with [[OpenDoc]]. Microsoft also later implemented stationery in a limited fashion via the Windows Start menu for Microsoft Office.

==International significance==
Within a few months of the Lisa's introduction in the US, fully translated versions of the software and documentation were commercially available for British, French, German, Italian, and Spanish markets, followed by several Scandinavian versions shortly thereafter. The user interface for the OS, all seven applications, LisaGuide, and the Lisa diagnostics (in ROM) can be fully translated, without any programming required, using resource files and a translation kit. The keyboard can identify its native language layout, and the entire user experience will be in that language, including any hardware diagnostic messages.

Although several foreign-language keyboard layouts were available, the [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]] keyboard layout was never ported to the Lisa, though such porting had been available for the Apple III, IIe, and IIc, and later for the Macintosh. Keyboard-mapping on the Lisa was complex and required building a new OS/kernel. All kernels contain images for all layouts, so due to serious memory constraints, keyboard layouts were stored as differences from a set of standard layouts, thus only a few bytes are needed to accommodate most additional layouts. A notable exception is the Dvorak layout that moves just about every key and thus requires hundreds of extra bytes of precious kernel storage regardless of whether it were needed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Each localized version (built on a globalized core) requires grammatical, linguistic, and cultural adaptations throughout the user interface, including formats for dates, numbers, times, currencies, sorting, even for word and phrase order in alerts and dialog boxes. A kit was provided, and the translation work was done by native-speaking Apple marketing staff in each country. This localization effort resulted in about as many Lisa unit sales outside the US as inside the US over the product's lifespan, while setting new standards for future localized software products, and for global project co-ordination.

==The end of the Lisa==
In 1987, [[Sun Remarketing]] purchased about 5,000 [[Macintosh XL]]s and upgraded them. Some leftover Lisa computers and spare parts are still available today.

In 1989, Apple disposed of approximately 2,700 unsold Lisas in a guarded landfill in [[Logan, Utah]], in order to receive a tax write-off on the unsold inventory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1999/1/1999_1_64.shtml American Heritage magazine article on the Apple Lisa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other early GUI computers, working Lisas are now fairly valuable [[collectors item]]s, for which people will pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars. The original model is the most sought after, although working ProFile and Widget hard disks, which are necessary for running the Lisa OS, are also particularly valued.

'''Apple juice''' is a [[juice|fruit juice]] manufactured by the [[Maceration (food)|maceration]] and pressing of [[apple]]s. The resulting expelled juice may be further treated by enzymatic and centrifugal clarification to remove the [[starch]] and [[pectin]], which holds fine particulate in suspension, and then [[pasteurization|pasteurize]]d for packaging in glass, metal or [[aseptic processing]] system containers, or further treated  by dehydration processes to a [[concentrate]]. Apple juice may also be sold in an untreated state.

Due to the complex and costly equipment required to extract and clarify juice from apples in large volume, apple juice is normally commercially produced. In the [[United States]], unfiltered fresh apple juice is produced by smaller operations in areas of high apple production, in the form of unclarified [[apple cider]]. Apple juice is one of the most common fruit juices in the world, with world production led by [[China]], [[Poland]], the United States, and [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ffas.usda.gov/htp/horticulture/Apple%20Juice/Apple%20Juice%20Feature%20May%202005.pdf USDA Foreign Agricultural Service.

Despite having some health benefits, apple juice is high in sugar. It has 28&amp;nbsp;g carbohydrates (24&amp;nbsp;g sugars) per 8 ounces. This results in 130 calories per 8 ounces (protein and fat are not significant), which is comparable to non-diet soft drinks such as [[Pepsi]] and [[7 Up]]. Also like most fruit juice, apple juice contains a similar amount of sugar as the raw fruit, but lacks the fiber content.

==Apple cider==
{{main|Apple cider}}
While ''apple juice'' generally refers to the filtered, pasteurised product of apple pressing, an unfiltered and sometimes unpasteurised product commonly known as apple cider in the United States and parts of Canada may be packaged and sold as ''apple juice''. In the U.S., there is an unclear distinction between filtered apple juice and ''natural'' apple cider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_048.html What's the difference between apple juice and apple cider?], ''The Straight Dope''. Retrieved 2008-02-20.&lt;/ref&gt; In other places such as New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom, apple cider is an alcoholic beverage.  The alcoholic beverage referred to as ''[[cider]]'' in these areas is usually referred to as ''hard cider'' in Japan.

'''Apple Lossless''' (also known as '''ALAC''' ('''Apple Lossless Audio Codec'''), or '''ALE''' ('''Apple Lossless Encoder''') is an [[audio codec]] developed by [[Apple Inc.]] for [[lossless data compression]] of digital [[music]]. After initially being [[proprietary format|proprietary]] for many years, in late 2011 Apple [[open-source software|open sourced]] and [[royalty-free]]d the Apple Lossless codec. It is worth noting that Apple does not use the ALAC abbreviation, always using the name Apple Lossless when presenting or discussing this codec, but it is more commonly referred to as ALAC outside of Apple.

==Codec==
Apple Lossless data is stored within an [[MPEG-4 Layer 14|MP4]] [[Container format (digital)|container]] with the [[filename extension]] ''[[.m4a]]''. This extension is also used by Apple for lossy AAC audio data in an MP4 container (same container, different audio encoding), though lossy AAC files, as sold through the [[iTunes Store]], are typically in their own ''.aac'' container extension. However, Apple Lossless is not a variant of [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] (which is a lossy format), but rather a distinct lossless format that uses [[linear prediction]] similar to other lossless codecs. These other lossless codecs, such as [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]] and [[Shorten]], are not natively supported in Apple's iTunes software, either on computers (Mac or Windows) or [[iDevices]], so users of iTunes software who want to use a lossless format (which allows the addition of metadata; unlike WAV/AIF, which [[WAV#Metadata|metadata is commonly ignored]], and other PCM-type formats) have to use ALAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.ffmpeg.devel/19686 | title=Re: Apple Lossless Audio Codec: Issues surrounding the release of my code? | accessdate=2006-11-05 | first=David | last=Hammerton | date=2005-03-01 | publisher=Gmane}}&lt;/ref&gt; All current [[iDevices]] can play ALAC–encoded files. ALAC also does not use any [[digital rights management|DRM]] scheme, but by the nature of the MP4 [[container format (digital)|container]], it is thought that DRM could be applied to ALAC much the same way it can with files in other QuickTime containers.

Apple claims that audio files compressed with its lossless codec will use up &quot;about half the storage space&quot; that the uncompressed data would require. Testers using a selection of music have found that compressed files are about 40% to 60% the size of the originals depending on the kind of music, similar to other lossless formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Lossless_comparison#Comparison_Table |title=Lossless comparison - Hydrogenaudio Knowledgebase}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcelhearn.com/2011/11/05/an-overview-of-apple-lossless-compression-results/&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the speed at which it can be decoded makes it useful for limited-power devices such as [[iOS]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.home.nl/w.speek/comparison.htm |title=Performance comparison of lossless audio compressors |author=Speek |date=2005-02-07 |accessdate=2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Apple Lossless Encoder (the software for encoding into ALAC files) was introduced into the Mac OS X [[Core Audio]] framework on April 28, 2004 together with the [[QuickTime]] 6.5.1 update, and thus available in [[iTunes]] as of version 4.5 and above. The codec is also used in the [[AirPort|AirPort Express]]'s [[AirPlay]] implementation.

The Apple Lossless Encoder (and decoder) was released as open source software under the [[Apache License]] version 2.0 on October 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alac.macosforge.org/ |title=Apple Lossless Audio Codec |publisher=alac.macosforge.org |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foresman |first=Chris |title=After seven years, Apple open sources its Apple Lossless Audio Codec |url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/10/after-seven-years-apple-open-sources-its-apple-lossless-audio-codec.ars |newspaper=[[Ars Technica]]  |date=2011-10-28 |accessdate=29-10-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://h-online.com/-1368212 |title=Apple open sources its ALAC lossless audio codec |author=Chris von Eitzen |newspaper=[[The H]] |date=2011-10-28 |accessdate=29-10-2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other players==
David Hammerton and [[Cody Brocious]] have analyzed and decoded this codec without any documents on the format. On March 5, 2005, Hammerton published a simple [[open source]] decoder in the programming language [[C (programming language)|C]] on the basis of the [[reverse engineering]] work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://craz.net/programs/itunes/alac.html |title=ALAC |publisher=crazney.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The open source library [[libavcodec]] incorporates both a decoder and an encoder for Apple Lossless format which means that media players based on that library, including [[VLC media player]] and [[MPlayer]], are able to play Apple Lossless files, as well as many media centre applications for [[home theater PC|home theatre computer]]s, such as [[Plex (software)|Plex]], [[XBMC]], and [[Boxee]]. The library was subsequently optimized for ARM processors and included in [[Rockbox]].

[[Image:Apple pie.jpg|thumb|right|Apple pie with [[Lattice (pastry)|lattice]] upper crust]]
[[Image:Tarte tatin.jpg|thumb|''[[Tarte Tatin]]'', a French variation on apple pie]]

An '''apple pie''' is a fruit [[pie]] (or tart) in which the principal filling ingredient is [[apple]]s. It is sometimes served with [[whipped cream]] or [[ice cream]] on top. Pastry is generally used top-and-bottom, making it a double-crust pie, the upper crust of which may be a circular shaped crust or a pastry lattice woven of strips; exceptions are deep-dish apple pie with a top crust only, and open-face [[Tarte Tatin]].

==Ingredients==
[[Cooking apple]]s (''culinary apples''), such as the [[Bramley (apple)|Bramley]] or [[Granny Smith]], are crisp and acidic. The fruit for the pie can be fresh, canned, or reconstituted from [[dried fruit|dried apple]]s. This affects the final texture, and the length of cooking time required; whether it has an effect on the flavour of the pie is a matter of opinion. Dried or preserved apples were originally substituted only at times when fresh [[fruit]] was unavailable.  A piece of [[cheese]] is occasionally placed on top of or alongside a slice of the finished pie, particularly in the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]].

===The English pudding===
[[Image:For to Make Tartys in Applis (1381).gif|right|thumb|&quot;For to Make Tartys in Applis&quot;, 18th century print of a 14th century recipe]]
English apple pie recipes go back to the time of [[Chaucer]]. The 1381 recipe (see illustration at right) lists the ingredients as ''good [[apple]]s, good [[spice]]s, [[ficus|fig]]s, [[raisin]]s and [[pear]]s.'' The ''cofyn'' of the recipe is a casing of pastry. [[Saffron]] is used for colouring the pie filling.

In English speaking countries, apple pie is a dessert of enduring popularity, eaten hot or cold, on its own or with [[ice cream]], [[cream|double cream]], or [[custard]].

====Absence of sugar in early English recipe====
Most modern recipes for apple pie require an ounce or two of [[sugar]], but the earliest recipe does not. There are two possible reasons.

[[Sugarcane]] imported from [[Egypt]] was not widely available in 14th century England, where it cost between one and two [[shilling]]s per [[pound (mass)|pound]]—this is roughly the equivalent of US$100 per kg (about US$50 per pound) in today's prices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sucrose.com/lhist.html How Sugar is Made - the History, Sugar Knowledge International]&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of sugar in the recipe may instead indicate that, because refined sugar was a recent introduction from the Orient, the medieval English did not have quite as sweet a tooth as their descendants. Honey, which was many times cheaper, is also absent from the recipe, and the &quot;good spices&quot; and saffron, all imported, were no less expensive and difficult to obtain than refined sugar. Despite the expense, refined sugar did appear much more often in published recipes of the time than honey, suggesting that it was not considered prohibitively expensive.  With the exception of apples and pears, all the ingredients in the filling probably had to be imported. And perhaps, as in some modern &quot;sugar-free&quot; recipes, the juice of the pears was intended to sweeten the pie.

===Dutch style===
[[File:Hollandse appeltaart.jpg|right|thumb|A home-baked Dutch apple pie]]
[[File:Dutch apple pie Sub Rosa Chiang Mai.jpg|right|thumb|Dutch apple pie in [[Chiang Mai]], Thailand, showing the filling]]
[[Dutch cuisine|Dutch]] apple pie (''appeltaart'' or ''appelgebak'') recipes are distinct in that they typically call for flavourings such as [[cinnamon]] and [[lemon juice]] to be added. Dutch apple pies are usually decorated in a lattice style. Dutch apple pies may include ingredients such as raisins and icing, in addition to ingredients such as apples and sugar, which they have in common with other recipes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kookhistorie.nl/images/vk-scan/vk-c3r.jpg page 21 &quot;De verstandige kock of sorghvuldige huyshoudster (anno 1669)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipes for Dutch apple pie go back centuries. There exists a painting from the [[Dutch Golden Age]], dated 1626, featuring such a pie.

The basis of Dutch apple pie is a crust on the bottom and around the edges. This is then filled with pieces or slices of apple, usually a crisp and mildly tart variety such as [[Goudreinet]] or [[Elstar]]. Cinnamon and [[sugar]] are generally mixed in with the apple filling. Atop the filling, strands of [[dough]] cover the pie in a [[Lattice (pastry)|lattice]], holding the filling in place but keeping it visible. It can be eaten warm or cold, sometimes with a dash of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

===Swedish style===
The [[Swedish cuisine|Swedish]] style apple pie differs from the English and Dutch style, in that it uses no pastry and hence has no crust. Simply, the apples are sliced and placed in the baking dish, the lightly spiced dough is mixed and then poured over the apples, and the whole lot placed in a pre-heated oven, making for quick and simple preparation and cooking. The resultant pie is akin to a hot cake, in which the apples are held in suspension and softened by the dough.

==Apple pie in American culture==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cracker (food)]] --&gt;
[[Image:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|An apple pie is one of a number of American cultural icons.]]

In the English colonies the apple pie had to wait for carefully planted pips, brought in barrels across the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]], to become fruit-bearing apple trees, to be selected for their cooking qualities. In the meantime, the [[Colonial America|colonists]] were more likely to make their pies, or &quot;[[Pasty|pasties]]&quot;, from meat rather than fruit; and the main use for apples, once they were available, was in [[cider]]. However, there are American apple pie recipes, both manuscript and printed, from the eighteenth century, and it has since become a very popular dessert.

Apple pie was a common food in eighteenth century Delaware. As noted by the New Sweden historian Dr. Israel Acrelius in a letter: “Apple pie is used throughout the whole year, and when fresh Apples are no longer to be had, dried ones are used. It is the evening meal of children.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stradley|first=Linda|title=Apple Pie - History of Apple Pie|url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PieHistory/ApplePie.htm|work=What's Cooking America.net|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mock apple pie made from [[cracker (food)|cracker]]s was apparently {{clarify|date=January 2012}} invented by [[frontier|pioneers]] on the move during the nineteenth century who were bereft of apples. In the 1930s, and for many years afterwards, [[Ritz Crackers]] promoted a recipe for mock apple pie using its product, along with sugar and various spices.

Although apple pies have been eaten since long before the [[European colonization of the Americas]], &quot;as American as apple pie&quot; is a saying in the United States, meaning &quot;typically American&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/as-american-as-apple-pie| title=Definition of &quot;as American as apple pie&quot;| journal= Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus| author=Cambridge University Press| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, apple pie became a symbol of American prosperity and national pride. A newspaper article published in 1902 declared that “No pie-eating people can be permanently vanquished.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Popular Apple Sayings|url=http://usapple.org/consumers/all-about-apples/history-and-folklore/popular-apple-sayings|publisher=U.S. Apple Association|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dish was also commemorated in the phrase &quot;for Mom and apple pie&quot; - supposedly the stock answer of American soldiers in [[World War II]], whenever journalists asked why they were going to war.&lt;ref&gt;http://piemaven.com/idioms.htm Pie idioms on PieMaven&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertisers exploited the patriotic connection in the 1970s with the commercial jingle &quot;[[baseball]], [[hot dogs]], apple pie and [[Chevrolet]]&quot;. There are claims that the Apple Marketing Board of New York State used such slogans as &quot;An apple a day keeps the doctor away&quot; and &quot;as American as apple pie!&quot;, and thus &quot;was able to successfully 'rehabilitate' the apple as a popular comestible&quot; in the early twentieth century when [[prohibition]] outlawed{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} the production of cider.

The unincorporated community of [[Pie Town, New Mexico]] is named in honor of the apple pie.

The '''Apple II Plus''' (stylised as Apple ][ ) is the second model of the [[Apple II series]] of [[personal computer]]s produced by [[Apple Computer, Inc.]]  It was sold new from June 1979 to December 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;a2h-06&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apple2history.org/history/ah06/ | title = 6 - The Apple II Plus | first = Steven | last = Weyhrich | work = Apple II History | date = 2010-11-24 | accessdate = 2010-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The Apple II Plus had a total of 48&amp;nbsp;KB of RAM, expandable to 64&amp;nbsp;KB by means of the Language Card, an expansion card that could be installed in the computer's slot 0. The Apple's [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] microprocessor could support a maximum of 64&amp;nbsp;KB of [[address space]], and a machine with 48KB RAM reached this limit because of the additional 12&amp;nbsp;KB of read-only memory and 4&amp;nbsp;KB of I/O addresses. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was [[bank switching|bank-switched]] over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the [[Integer BASIC|Integer]] and [[Applesoft BASIC|Applesoft]] dialects of BASIC with [[Apple DOS|DOS 3.3]]'s &lt;tt&gt;INT&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;FP&lt;/tt&gt; commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. The Language Card was also required to use [[LOGO programming language|LOGO]], [[Apple Pascal]], and [[FORTRAN|FORTRAN 77]].  Apple Pascal and FORTRAN ran under a non-DOS operating system based on [[UCSD p-System|UCSD P-System]], which had its own disk format and included a &quot;[[virtual machine]]&quot; that allowed it to run on many different types of hardware.

The Apple II Plus included the [[Applesoft BASIC]] programming language in ROM. This [[Microsoft]]-authored dialect of BASIC, which was previously available as an upgrade, supported [[floating-point arithmetic]] (though it ran at a noticeably slower speed than Steve Wozniak's Integer BASIC) and became the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple.

Like the [[Apple II]], the Apple II Plus had no [[lowercase]] functionality.  All letters from the keyboard were upper-case, there was no [[caps lock]] key, and there were no lowercase letters in the text-mode [[font]] stored in the computer's [[Read-Only Memory|ROM]].  To display lowercase letters, some applications would run in the slower ''hi-res graphics mode'' and use a custom font, rather than running in the fast ''text mode'' using the font in ROM.  Other programs, primarily those where both capitalization and text movement were important, such as [[word processor]]s, used inverse text mode to represent text that would be lowercase when printed. Alternatively, users could install a custom ROM chip that contained lowercase letters in the font, or purchase one of several third-party ''80-column cards'' that enabled a text mode that could display 80-column, upper- and lower-case text. The &quot;[[Videx]] Videoterm&quot; card and its many clones were especially popular. For lowercase input, since it was not possible to detect whether the keyboard's Shift keys were in use, a modification called the &quot;one-wire shift key mod&quot; connected the Shift key to one of the pins on the motherboard's [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]] connector.  Compatible applications, including nearly all [[word processor]]s, could then detect whether the shift key was being pressed. This modification, however, involved adding wires inside the Apple II, and was therefore only popular among hobbyists. For this reason, most applications that could support lower-case letters could also use the ESC key as a substitute lowercase toggle if the &quot;shift key mod&quot; was not installed.  The II Plus had a plastic case with brass mesh running along the inside of the case. This mesh protected the computer from [[electromagnetic interference|harmful radio frequency energy]].  Small grids of plastic pins, and sometimes [[Velcro]], was used to hold the case's top onto the computer.

Furthermore, the Apple II Plus, like its predecessor the Apple II, had a repeat key built into its keyboard. The key was labeled &quot;REPT&quot; and was located just to the left of the Enter key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Espinosa|first=Christopher|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Apple II Reference Manual| publisher=Apple Computer, Inc.|year=1979|location=|pages=7|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/museum/books_manuals/a2refman.html|title= Apple II History Museum - Books: Manuals|accessdate=2009-10-15|last=Weyhrich|first=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The II Plus was the last Apple Computer to have this key, as later Apple computers would incorporate the ability to hold down a key for a period of time to repeat the key.

===Apple II Europlus and J-Plus===
After the success of the first Apple II in the United States, Apple expanded its market to include [[Europe]] and the [[Far East]] in 1978, with the '''Apple II Europlus''' (Europe) and the '''Apple II J-Plus''' (Japan). In these models, Apple made the necessary hardware, software and [[firmware]] changes in order to comply to standards outside of the US. The [[power supply]] was modified to accept the local voltage, and in the European model the video output signal was changed from color [[NTSC]] to monochrome [[PAL]] by changing some [[jumper (computing)|jumper]]s on the motherboard and using a slightly different frequency [[crystal oscillator]] — an extra video card (which only worked in slot 7) was needed for color [[PAL]] graphics, since the simple tricks Wozniak had used to generate a pseudo-NTSC signal with minimal hardware did not carry over to the more complex PAL system. In the Japanese version of the international Apple, the character ROM and the keyboard layout were changed to allow for [[Katakana]] writing (full [[Kanji]] support was clearly beyond the capabilities of the machine), but in most other countries the international Apple was sold with an unmodified American keyboard; thus the German model still lacked the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]]s, for example, and had a [[QWERTY]] layout instead of the standard German [[QWERTZ]]. For the most part, the Apple II Europlus and J-Plus were identical to the Apple II Plus and software compatibility was near 100%. Production of the Europlus ended in 1983.

===Bell &amp; Howell===
The Apple II Plus was also sold by [[Bell &amp; Howell]] specifically to educational markets under special license from Apple.  The normal consumer Apple II Plus was not [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]]-listed because the top could be opened; the B&amp;H model was the same as the consumer version sold by Apple except that it came in a black case, which could not be as easily opened, and a special [[A/V]] package allowing it to be sold as audio/visual equipment.  Bell &amp; Howell packaged the unit with optional &quot;back packs&quot; that offered various inputs and outputs for A/V equipment to easily interface with the II Plus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macgeek.org/museum/bhapple2plus/ Apple II Plus - Bell &amp; Howell Model] {{verify credibility|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=December 2010}} This was the only black computer Apple would manufacture until the [[Macintosh TV]] in 1993.

===Military applications===
A [[TEMPEST]]-approved version of the Apple II Plus called the Microfix was developed in 1980 by the [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]] for [[U.S. Army]] [[FORSCOM]]. Fielded in 1982, the Microfix system was the first tactical system using video disk ([[Laserdisc]]) map technology providing zoom and scroll over map imagery coupled with a point database of intelligence data such as [[order of battle]], airfields, roadways, and bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://training.esri.com/campus/library/Bibliography/RecordDetail.cfm?ID=16159|title=The development of small computer geographic analysis systems for military applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.falconview.org/trac/FalconView/raw-attachment/wiki/Presentations/Moving_Maps.pdf|title= Moving Maps: Evolution in GIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm34_3.pdf|title=U.S. Army Field Manual 34-3, Intelligence Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apple bobbing''', also known as '''bobbing for apples''', is a game often played in connection with [[Halloween]]. The game is played by filling a tub or a large basin with water and putting [[apple]]s in the water. Because apples are less dense than water, they will float at the surface. Players (usually children) then try to catch one with their teeth. Use of hands is not allowed, and often are tied behind the back to prevent cheating. 

In Scotland, this may be called &quot;dooking&quot;,&quot;&lt;ref name=dook&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/south_of_scotland/7648188.stm Apple dookers make record attempt], BBC News, 2 October, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. [[wikt:duck#Verb|ducking]].

In Ireland, mainly [[County Kerry]], it is known as &quot;Snap Apple&quot;, and in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], ''Snap Apple Night'' is a synonym name for Halloween.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XrVbk3EndTcC&amp;pg=PA500&amp;lpg=PA500&amp;dq=%22Snap+apple%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Ho3xtaGQFD&amp;sig=W3S7XcyQf2jfio0NKGYUBHDilm4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result Dictionary of Newfoundland English], George Morley Story, W. J. Kirwin, John David Allison, p500, ISBN 0802068197&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Image:Christy's Halloween.jpg|thumb|''[[Halloween]]'' ([[Howard Chandler Christy]]), 1915]]
The current game dates back to when the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Romans conquered Britain]], bringing with them the [[apple tree]], a representation of the goddess of fruit trees, [[Pomona]]. The combination of Pomona, a [[fertility goddess]], and the [[Celts]]' belief that the [[pentagram]] was a fertility symbol began the origins of bobbing for apples{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. When an apple is sliced in half, the seeds form a pentagram-like shape, and it is thought that the manifestation of such a symbol meant that the apple could be used to determine marriages during this time of year. From this belief comes the game bobbing for apples{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. During the annual celebration, young unmarried people try to bite into an apple floating in water or hanging from a string; the first person to bite into the apple would be the next one to marry.
  
The custom is mentioned (along with apples suspended on  a string) in 18th century Ireland by [[Charles Vallancey]] in his book '''Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis'''.

The current game is based on a New Year tradition, where whoever chokes on the apple first in the group will be the first to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Halloween |first=Silver |last=RavenWolf |publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide |year=1999 |isbn=1567187196 |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similar tradition of throwing rice at a wedding evolved from this, except apples were thrown originally.  However, the popularity of throwing other types of fruits such as peaches and pears is believed to be making a comeback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Around the World of Food |first=John A |last=La Boone |publisher=iUniverse |year=2006 |isbn=0595389686 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls who place the apple they bobbed under their pillows are said to dream of their future lover.&lt;ref name=silv/&gt;

==Health Risks==

Due to the nature of the game, whereupon a number of individuals each place their entire head into a bowl of water, it is thought to be a somewhat unsanitary game to play, and is therefore falling out of favour with some groups &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roanoke.com/extra/wb/wb/xp-38185 |title=Washed up? |first=Jenny |last=Kincaid |work=[[The Roanoke Times]] |date=2005-10-28 |accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A potentially more sanitary variation of the game exists, with the apples hung on string on a line, rather than in a bowl of water.&lt;ref name=silv&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jk0bvrg-v1UC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=%22apple+bobbing%22++-carving&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=odX9SP6sOJCEswPtpuCmDA#PPA77,M1 Halloween], Silver RavenWolf, p77, ISBN 1567187196. Retrieved 21 October, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Novels==
[[Agatha Christie]]'s mystery novel, ''[[Hallowe'en Party]],'' is about a girl who is drowned in an apple-bobbing tub.

The '''Apple Remote''' is a [[remote control]] made for use with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] products with [[infrared]] capabilities released after October 2005. The device was announced by [[Steve Jobs]] on October 12, 2005. The remote is largely based on the interface of the first generation [[iPod Shuffle]] and has only seven buttons. The seven buttons on the remote are for Menu, Play/Pause, Volume Up, Volume Down, Previous/Rewind, Next/Fast-forward, and a central select button. The remote was originally designed to interact with [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]] in the [[iMac G5]] and is also compatible with the [[MacBook]] and MacBook Pro. The [[Mac Mini]] with Apple Remote support was announced on February 26, 2006.  The [[Apple TV]] also ships with and utilizes the Apple Remote.

The remote was designed to attach magnetically to the side of the late G5 and early Intel [[iMac]]s. These models integrated several hidden magnets in the bottom right corner which attract the remote's battery. This is also possible with the frame of MacBook screens.  As of February 2008, the [[MacBook]] and [[MacBook Pro]] no longer include an Apple Remote in the package, though it remains compatible and available as an option for the [[MacBook Pro]]. As of March 2009, the [[iMac]] and [[Mac Mini]] also no longer ship with an Apple Remote in the package.

In October 2009 the original white plastic remote was replaced with a thinner and longer aluminum version. The new aluminum remote was released along with the 27&amp;nbsp;inch aluminum [[iMacs]] and [[multi-touch]] [[Magic Mouse]]. It also introduced a few changes in the six-button layout. The Play/Pause button was moved out of the center of the directional buttons, placing it aside the Menu button (under the directional buttons). The symbols for the Volume Up/Down and Next/Fast-forward buttons were replaced with small dots. This was to make it more obvious that the buttons were also used to move up, down, left, and right within menus. All of the buttons became black and embossed within the aluminum. Along with the new design, the price was dropped to $19.99.

The [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]] application allows users to browse and play music, view videos ([[DVD]]s and downloaded files) and browse photos. The Apple Remote is also compatible with the [[iPod Hi-Fi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Using the Apple Remote with iPod Hi-Fi |date={{Start date|2008|04|14}} |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1697 |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Universal Dock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Pairing the Apple Remote with the iPod Universal Dock |date={{Start date|2010|05|03}} |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4154 |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The functions for the [[iPod#Universal Dock|iPod Universal Dock]] allow for music and media control, though the remote is not able to control the menus within the iPod. The battery is accessed by pushing a small, blunt object, such as a paper clip or a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm headphone plug, into a tiny indent at the bottom right edge of the remote, revealing the compartment which houses the CR2032 lithium 3.0 V button cell (1st Gen). Use a coin to access the battery on the back of the remote (2nd Gen)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=How to replace the Apple Remote battery |date={{Start date|2008|06|06}} |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1306 |accessdate={{Start date|2010|06|21}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shortcuts ==
=== Pairing ===
A device can be configured to respond only to a certain remote. This can be achieved by holding the Apple Remote close enough to the device with which it is to be paired, and then pressing and holding the &quot;Menu&quot; and &quot;Next&quot; (or &quot;Play&quot;; this option also increments the remote ID before pairing) buttons for five seconds. Pairing can be removed by holding the &quot;Menu&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; buttons for five seconds or deactivating it under the [[Mac OS X]] &quot;Security&quot; System Preference pane. Only users with [[system administrator|administrative privileges]] are allowed to pair their remote; in a non-administrator account, pressing the buttons will have no effect and nothing will be displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Pairing your Apple Remote with your computer |date={{Start date|2009|11|24}} |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1619 |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pairing can be very useful because some users who have both an iMac and Apple TV nearby experience issues with remotes working with both devices.

=== Sleep ===
Users can put [[iMac]]s, [[MacBook Pro]]s, [[MacBook]]s, [[Intel]] [[Mac Mini]]s, [[Apple TV]]s, or docked [[iPod]]s into [[sleep mode]] by holding down the Play/Pause button on the Apple Remote. Devices can also be awakened by pressing any button on the remote.

=== Boot options ===
Holding down the Menu button on the remote while starting up an Intel Macintosh enters the Startup Manager&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Startup Manager: How to select a startup volume |date={{Start date|2009|03|23}} |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1310 |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (same as holding the Option key at startup). The remote can then be used to cycle through all bootable partitions and can then confirm them by pressing the Play/Pause button. This can be especially useful for [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] users who might frequently use this feature to boot into [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[disk partitioning|partitions]] on the Intel Macs. The remote can also eject [[CD]]s or [[DVD]]s in this menu by selecting the disc and then pressing the + (Volume Up) button on the remote.

=== iOS App ===
{{Main|iTunes Remote}}
Apple also offers a free '[[iTunes Remote|Remote]]' app for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] devices (available in the [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]) which allows for wireless control of iTunes on Mac/[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computers or the Apple TV.

== Application compatibility ==
The remote can be used to control presentations in [[Apple Keynote]] (on both Intel Macs &amp; [[PowerPC]] Macs), presentations in [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] 2008 or in [[OpenOffice.org Impress]], picture slide shows in [[iPhoto]] and [[Aperture]], [[QuickTime]], [[DVD Player (software)|DVD Player]], and audio in [[iTunes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  

=== VLC compatibility ===
In response to the new [[Intel]] processors, a small piece of software called the Apple Remote Helper has surfaced to allow remote use in the [[VLC media player]]. Play, pause, volume, and skip buttons all work normally. It should be noted, however, that the volume buttons change VLC's volume, and not the system volume. Starting with release 0.8.6-test1 VLC itself supports the Apple Remote and no secondary software installation is required.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The latest version of VLC (1.0.5) enables all functionality with the latest Apple Remote. (Except the function of sleep).

== Hardware compatibility ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
===Compatibility with newer Macs===
The Apple remote is not supported on the 2010 or 2011 [[Macbook Air]] laptops. The Apple remote is supported on all older editions of the Macbook Air. The Apple Remote is not compatible with certain models of the White Unibody MacBook, which is now discontinued. It works with all MacBook Pros and all iMacs, as well as Mac Minis.

=== Compatibility with older Macs ===
Using the third-party remote software mira (from Twisted Melon) or Remote Buddy (from IOSPIRIT GmbH) users of older Macs can use the Apple Remote with a USB-based IR receiver. Most new Mac models come equipped with a built-in infrared receiver, but previous generation products lack any such IR device. Even the Mac Pro desktops released in the summer of 2006 lack built-in IR. Using Remote Buddy or mira, it is possible to connect an external USB receiver such as the [[Windows Media Center]] Edition eHome receiver, and use the Apple Remote on older machines with full support for sleep, pairing, low battery detection, and [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]]. In addition, Remote Buddy is able to emulate events of an Apple Remote on these systems, enabling users to use software written for the Apple Remote in exactly the same way as with newer Macs.

=== iPod compatibility ===
An [[iPod]] placed in a [[Apple Dock Connector|dock]] featuring an IR sensor can be controlled via the Apple Remote. However, the remote's menu functionality does not work on the iPod.

=== Compatibility with other devices ===
The Apple Remote can also be used to control the [[iPod Hi-Fi]] or third party devices tailored to it.

== Boot Camp compatibility ==
As of [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] 1.2, the remote has been given some compatibility when a user is running [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. If the user has [[iTunes]] installed on the Windows partition, pressing the Menu button on the remote will load the program. As well as this, the remote has the ability to control both [[Windows Media Player]] and iTunes, as well as system Volume Control. Additionally, the remote also has the ability to control the audio program [[foobar2000]] and the freeware media program [[Media Player Classic]]. Programs must have focus for the remote to control them. Skipping tracks and pausing/playing functionality are available under the programs. Since Boot Camp is now at version 4.0, this information is most likely very out of date. But still very useful.

== MacBook and iMac resting place ==
Earlier models of the iMac (Polycarbonate iMac) featured a magnetic rest for the remote,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=iMac (Mid 2007): No Remote rest for Apple Remote |date={{Start date|2007|08|13}} |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA24898 |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later (Aluminum iMac) taken out.

The MacBook features magnets in its lid (primarily intended for the magnetic latch) which also act as rests for the Apple Remote.

== Infrared interference ==
Because many electrical appliances use infrared remote (IR) controls, concurrent use of the Apple Remote with other IR remotes may scramble communications and generate interference, preventing stable use. Remotes should be used individually to circumvent the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Apple TV: IR interference can prevent your remote from working |date={{Start date|2007|03|22}} |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA24608 |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical details ==
The Apple Remote uses an [[Consumer_IR#Standards|NEC IR protocol]][http://wiki.altium.com/display/ADOH/NEC+Infrared+Transmission+Protocol] which consists of a differential [[pulse-position modulation|PPM]] encoding on a 1:3 [[duty cycle]] 38[[kHz]] 950 [[nanometre|nm]] [[infrared]] carrier. There are 32 bits of encoded data between the [[automatic gain control|AGC]] leader and the stop bit:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Callendrello |first=Casey |title=Apple Remote library for Arduinio |date={{Start date|2008|10|11}} |publisher=caseyc.net |url=http://www.caseyc.net/home/appleremote |accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

The first two bytes sent are the Apple custom code ID (0xEE followed by 0x87), which are followed by a one byte command and a one byte remote ID (0-255) making a total of 32 bits of data. All bytes are sent [[least significant bit]] first. The commands consist of:

'''''Malus''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|m|eɪ|l|ə|s}}&lt;ref&gt;''Sunset Western Garden Book,'' 1995:606–607&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|l|ə|s}}), the '''apples''', are a genus of about 30–35 species of small [[deciduous]] [[tree]]s or [[shrub]]s in the family [[Rosaceae]]. Other studies go as far as 55 species&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Phipps, J.B. et aL.| title=A checklist of the subfamily Maloideae (Rosaceae)| journal=Can. J. Bot.| year=1990| volume=68 | pages=2209 | doi=10.1139/b90-288 | issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the domesticated [[Apple|Orchard Apple]], or Table apple as it was formerly called (''M. domestica'', derived from ''[[M. sieversii]]'', syn. ''M. pumila'').  The other species and subspecies are generally known as &quot;wild apples&quot;, &quot;crab apples&quot;, &quot;crabapples&quot; or &quot;crabs&quot;.

The genus is native to the [[temperate]] zone of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], in [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]].

Apple trees are typically 4–12 m tall at maturity, with a dense, twiggy crown. The [[leaf|leaves]] are 3–10&amp;nbsp;cm long, alternate, simple, with a serrated margin. The [[flower]]s are borne in [[corymb]]s, and have five [[petal]]s, which may be white, pink or red, and are [[Plant sexuality|perfect]], with usually red stamens that produce copious [[pollen]], and a [[Ovary (plants)#Half-inferior ovary|half-inferior ovary]]; flowering occurs in the spring after 50–80 [[growing degree day]]s (varying greatly according to subspecies and cultivar).

Apples require [[cross-pollination]] between individuals by [[insect]]s (typically [[bee]]s, which freely visit the flowers for both [[nectar]] and [[pollen]]); all are self-sterile, and (with the exception of a few specially developed cultivars) self-pollination is impossible, making pollinating insects essential. ''Malus'' species, including domestic apples, [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridize]] freely. ''Malus'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of a large number of [[Lepidoptera]] species; see [[list of Lepidoptera that feed on Malus]].
[[Image:Malus fruit.jpg|thumb|left|Crabapple fruit are mostly red,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3pyZi8gSU8 Macro video of a ''Malus Evereste'' apple on a tree in winter]&lt;/ref&gt; but some, such as this cultivar 'Golden Hornet', are yellow]]

The [[fruit]] is a globose [[pome]], varying in size from 1–4&amp;nbsp;cm diameter in most of the wild species, to 6&amp;nbsp;cm in ''M. sylvestris sieversii'', 8&amp;nbsp;cm in ''M. sylvestris domestica'', and even larger in certain cultivated orchard apples; among the largest-fruited cultivars (all of which originate in North America) are 'Wolf River' and 'Stark Jumbo' . The centre of the fruit contains five [[carpel]]s arranged star-like, each containing one to two (rarely three) [[seed]]s.

One species, ''Malus trilobata'' from southwest [[Asia]], has three- to seven-lobed leaves (superficially resembling a [[maple]] leaf) and with several structural differences in the fruit; it is often treated in a genus of its own, as ''Eriolobus trilobatus''.

== Uses ==
For ''Malus sylvestris domestica'', see [[Apple]]. The fruit of the other species is not an important crop in most areas, being extremely sour and (in some species) woody, and is rarely eaten raw for this reason. In some southeast Asian cultures they are valued as a sour condiment, sometimes eaten with salt and chili pepper, or shrimp paste.

Crabapples are an excellent source of [[pectin]], and their juice can be made into a ruby-coloured [[jelly (fruit preserves)|preserve]] with a full, spicy flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rombauer|first=I.|authorlink=Irma S. Rombauer|coauthors=Becker, M. R., &amp; Becker, E.|title=All About Canning &amp; Preserving ([[The Joy of Cooking]] series)|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|origyear=2002|pages=72|isbn=0-7432-1502-8|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small percentage of crabapples in [[cider]] makes a more interesting flavour.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} As [[Old English]] ''Wergulu'', the crab apple is one of the nine plants invoked in the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan Anglo-Saxon]] ''[[Nine Herbs Charm]]'', recorded in the 10th century.

Crabapples are widely grown as ornamental trees, grown for their beautiful flowers or fruit, with numerous [[cultivar]]s selected for these qualities and for resistance to disease.

Some crabapples are used as rootstocks for domestic apples to add beneficial characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardening.cornell.edu/factsheets/ecogardening/appleroot.html Apple Tree Rootstocks Ecogardening Factsheet #21, Summer 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, varieties of Baccata, also called Siberian crab, rootstock is used to give additional cold hardiness to the combined plant for orchards in cold northern areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnr.state.ak.us/ag/21Applerootstocks.pdf Alaska Department of Natural Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also used as [[pollinizer]]s in apple [[orchard]]s.  Varieties of crabapple are selected to bloom contemporaneously with the apple variety in an orchard planting, and the crabs are planted every sixth or seventh tree, or limbs of a crab tree are grafted onto some of the apple trees. In emergencies, a bucket or drum bouquet of crabapple flowering branches are placed near the beehives as orchard pollenizers. See also [[Fruit tree pollination]].
Because of the plentiful blossoms and small fruit, crabapples are popular for use in [[bonsai]] culture; however, because the tiny trees still show the abundant, full-sized fruit of normal crabapples, it is important to thin out the fruit so that the trees do not exhaust themselves.

The Chestnut Crabapple is an exception in that its fruit is sweet tasting.{{Citation needed|reason=Sept 2009|date=September 2009}} A very hardy plant, the Chestnut Crabapple blooms in early to mid-May and is an excellent pollinator for other fruit apples.  It produces a very large crabapple, up to 2&quot; (5&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter, that ripens in early September with a pleasant nut-like flavor and good texture for fresh eating.  The fruit quality holds well on the tree, being quite spritely at first and becoming sweeter later on, with a medium storage life.

Apple wood gives off a pleasant scent when burned, and smoke from an apple wood fire gives an excellent flavour to smoked foods.&lt;ref name=Fraser&gt;Fraser, Anna. &quot;Properties of different trees as firewood&quot; 22 August 2005, 17 July 2008. Available at: [http://web.archive.org:80/web/20071011022757/www.the-tree.org.uk/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; It is easier to cut when green; dry apple wood is exceedingly difficult to carve by hand &lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt; It is a good wood for cooking fires because it burns hot and slow, without producing much flame.&lt;ref name=Fraser/&gt;

[[Apple Inc.]] is an American [[multinational corporation]] with a focus on designing and manufacturing consumer electronics and software products. It was established in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[California]] on April 1, 1976 by [[Steve Jobs]], [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Ronald Wayne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2003-03-23|accessdate=2008-04-13|url=http://www.time.com/time/80days/760401.html|title=80 Days that Changed the World |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated on January 3, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=107357&amp;p=irol-faq|title=Investor Relations FAQ |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's hardware products include the [[Macintosh]] line of personal computers, the [[iPod]] line of portable media players,the iPad line of tablets, and the [[iPhone]] line of mobile phones. Apple's software products include the [[Mac OS X]] operating system, the [[iTunes]] media browser, and the [[iLife]] suite of multimedia and creativity software.&lt;ref name=4qresults&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/10/22results.html|title=Apple Reports Fourth Quarter Results |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=2007-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has acquired twenty-one companies, purchased a stake in two companies, and made five divestments; most of them were [[software companies]]. Apple has not released the financial details for most of these mergers and acquisitions.

Apple's business philosophy is to acquire small companies that can be easily integrated into existing company projects.&lt;ref name=businessweek /&gt; For example, Apple acquired [[Emagic]] and its professional music software, [[Logic Pro]], in 2002. The acquisition led to the creation of the [[digital audio workstation]] software, [[GarageBand]], now part of the [[iLife]] software suite.&lt;ref name=businessweek&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2007/tc20070301_402290.htm|title=What to Do with Apple's Cash |publisher=[[BusinessWeek]]|date=2007-03-01|author=Hesseldahl, Arik }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company made its first acquisition on March 2, 1988 when it purchased Network Innovations. It has also made five [[divestment]]s, all in the 1990s, in which parts of the company are sold to another company. The company's largest acquisition was the purchase of [[NeXT]] in 1996 for [[US$]]400 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-25|url=http://sec.edgar-online.com/1996/12/24/00/0000320193-96-000027/Section5.asp|title=Apple Computer, Inc.

Of the companies that Apple has acquired, 18 were based in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26646">{{About|digital rights management system||Fair Play (disambiguation)}}
'''FairPlay''' is a [[digital rights management]] (DRM) technology created by [[Apple Inc.]], based on technology created by the company [[Veridisc]].  FairPlay is built into the [[QuickTime]] multimedia software and used by the [[iPhone]], [[iPod]], [[iPad]], [[Apple TV]], [[iTunes]], and [[iTunes Store]] and the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].  Formerly, all songs in the [[iTunes Store]] were encoded with FairPlay. Apple later started offering a selection of songs that, after an additional 50 cents is paid per song, could be downloaded FairPlay-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/04/02itunes.html|accessdate=22 June 2011|title=Apple Unveils Higher Quality DRM-Free Music on the iTunes Store}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, in the US, Apple does not sell songs with FairPlay encryption {{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1711|title=Can I still buy music encoded at 128 Kbps with Digital Rights Management (DRM)?}}. FairPlay digitally [[encryption|encrypts]] [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] audio files and prevents users from playing these files on unauthorized computers. 

The majority of FairPlay-encrypted content is purchased through the iTunes Store, using the iTunes software. The iTunes software relies on Apple's Quicktime multimedia software for decoding and playback of the encrypted files. Every media player capable of using QuickTime is capable of playing back FairPlay-encrypted files, including [[RealPlayer]], [[Media Center (software application)|Media Center]], [[Media Player Classic]] and [[Songbird (software)|Songbird]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://addons.songbirdnest.com/addon/23 &quot;Songbird&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
FairPlay-protected files are regular [[MPEG-4 Layer 14|MP4]] container files with an encrypted [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] audio stream. The audio stream is encrypted using the [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] algorithm in combination with [[MD5]] hashes. The master key required to decrypt the encrypted audio stream is also stored in encrypted form in the MP4 container file. The key required to decrypt the master key is called the &quot;user key&quot;.

Each time a new customer uses iTunes to buy a track, a new random user key is generated and used to encrypt the master key. The random user key is stored, together with the account information, on Apple’s servers, and also sent to iTunes. iTunes stores these keys in its own encrypted key repository. Using this key repository, iTunes is able to retrieve the user key required to decrypt the master key. Using the master key, iTunes is able to decrypt the AAC audio stream and play it.

When a user authorizes a new computer, iTunes sends a unique machine identifier to Apple’s servers. In return it receives all the user keys that are stored with the account information. This ensures that Apple is able to limit the number of computers that are authorized and makes sure that each authorized computer has all the user keys that are needed to play the tracks that it bought.

When a user deauthorizes a computer, iTunes will instruct Apple’s servers to remove the unique machine identifier from their database, and at the same time it will remove all the user keys from its encrypted key repository.

The iPod also has its own encrypted key repository. Every time a FairPlay-protected track is copied onto the iPod, iTunes will copy the user key from its own key repository to the key repository on the iPod. This makes sure that the iPod has everything it needs to play the encrypted AAC audio stream. 

FairPlay does not affect the ability of the file itself to be copied.  It only manages the decryption of the audio content.

==Restrictions==

FairPlay-encrypted audio tracks allow the following:

* The track may be copied to any number of [[iPod]] portable music players (including the [[iPhone]]).&lt;ref name=authorize&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/store/authorization/ |title=Apple - Support - iTunes Store - Authorization FAQ |publisher=Apple.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, each iPod/iPhone can only have tracks from a maximum of five different iTunes accounts)
* The track may be played on up to five (originally three) authorized computers simultaneously.&lt;ref name=authorize /&gt;
* A particular playlist within [[iTunes]] containing a FairPlay-encrypted track can be copied to a CD only up to seven times (originally ten times) before the playlist must be changed.&lt;ref name=burncd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=93360 |title=Can't burn a CD in iTunes for Windows |publisher=Docs.info.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The track may be copied to a standard Audio [[CD]] any number of times.&lt;ref name=burncd /&gt;
** The resulting CD has no DRM and may be ripped, encoded and played back like any other CD. However, CDs created by users do not attain [[first sale]] rights and cannot be legally leased, lent, sold or distributed to others by the creator.
** The CD audio still bears the artifacts of compression, so converting it back into a [[lossy]] format such as [[MP3]] may aggravate the sound artifacts of encoding (see [[transcoding]]). When re-ripping such a CD one could use a lossless audio codec such as [[AIFF]], [[Apple Lossless]], [[FLAC]] or [[WAV]] however such files take up significantly more space than the original .mp4 files.

At this time, it appears that the restrictions mentioned above are hard-coded into QuickTime and the iTunes application, and not configurable in the protected files themselves!

Fairplay prevents iTunes customers from using the purchased music directly on any portable digital music player other than the [[Apple iPod]], [[Motorola ROKR E1]], [[Motorola SLVR]], [[Motorola RAZR V3i]], the [[iPhone]] and the [[iPad]].

==Legal issues==
On January 3, 2005, an iTunes [[online music store]] customer, Thomas Slattery, filed a lawsuit against [[Apple Inc.]], alleging the company broke [[antitrust]] laws by using FairPlay with iTunes so that purchased music will work only with its own music player, the iPod, freezing out competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3455431 |title=InternetNews Realtime IT News – Apple Hit by Lawsuit |publisher=Internetnews.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though most of the complaints have been dropped, the case has since been combined with two other lawsuits and continues today under the temporary name &quot;The Apple iPod iTunes Antitrust Litigation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000110465907037745/a07-13266_110q.htm | title=Apple Inc. 10-Q| date=2007-05-10 | work=[[EDGAR]] | pages=38 | accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2004, [[Virgin Megastores|VirginMega]] filed a complaint with the [[Autorité de la concurrence|French Competition Council]] against Apple regarding its refusal to license Fairplay to VirginMega for use in their own online music commerce store. The Council (''Conseil'') rejected the complaint over accused anti-competitive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-concurrence.fr/pdf/avis/04d54.pdf Décision n° 04-D-54 du 9 novembre 2004 relative à des pratiques mises en oeuvre par la société Apple Computer, Inc. dans les secteurs du téléchargement de musique sur Internet et des baladeurs numériques]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Conseil ruled against the notion that FairPlay was an &quot;[[Essential facilities doctrine|essential facility]]&quot; for three distinct reasons: 1) Playing purchased music on portable players was a small part of the market; 2) CD Burning provides an adequate work-around to get purchased music from other vendors onto an iPod; and 3) There is sufficient availability of portable players that support Microsoft's WMA DRM as a viable alternative and choice for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reckon.co.uk/open/iTunes iTunes, DRM and competition law]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circumvention==
After the launch of the iTunes Store, multiple people attempted to circumvent the encryption of FairPlay-protected files.

===QTFairUse===
[[Jon Johansen]] – also known for his [[DeCSS]] program – was the first to devise a way to circumvent the DRM. The [[open source]] application [[QTFairUse]] intercepted the decrypted output and wrote it to a raw AAC file. Many media players do not support such raw files and the files had to be processed with a tool like [[Advanced Audio Coding#FAAC and FAAD2|FAAD]] to create normal files. One of the few media players that is able to play raw AAC files is [[foobar2000]].

The second time around, Johansen [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] the encryption technique used in FairPlay and created an algorithm to completely remove the encryption without re-encoding the encrypted AAC stream. This method was also used by [[VLC media player]] in order to play FairPlay-protected tracks until a newer version of iTunes and FairPlay broke it.

Only a few days after the release of iTunes 7.0 the experimental version 2.3 of QTFairUse6, a derivative of the python open source [[QTFairUse]], was released which dumps each track to a raw AAC file which then can be converted to any format.

Jon Johansen himself also released a tool to remove the encryption, called DeDRMS. Later he released FairKeys, which uses Apple’s own servers to retrieve the keys needed by DeDRMS.

All these applications have two things in common. First, they employ the user keys from either the Apple servers, the iTunes key repository, or the iPod key repository, which ensures they can decrypt only files that are legally bought; a user cannot use these applications to decrypt files that another user bought. Second, they keep user specific metadata inside the MP4 container intact, so it is possible to identify the user who originally bought the file after it is decrypted.

In March 2005, it was revealed through a front end of the iTunes Store called [[PyMusique]] that the FairPlay DRM was added only as a song was being purchased from the store by the client software itself.

In October 2006, [[Jon Johansen]] announced that instead of breaking FairPlay, he had reverse-engineered it so that other companies could play their DRM-protected music and movies on iPods and Apple's new [[Apple TV]]. His company, [[doubleTwist]], would license the technology to media companies who wished to have their media playable on the iPod or Apple TV, with the protection of FairPlay DRM, but without having to go through Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gannes |first=Liz |title=DVD Jon Fairplays Apple |publisher=[[GigaOM]] |date=2006-10-02 |url=http://featured.gigaom.com/2006/10/02/dvd-jon-fairplays-apple/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071102203847rn_1/gigaom.com/2006/10/02/dvd-jon-fairplays-apple/ |archivedate=2007-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Playfair, Hymn, and JHymn===
A software package named [[Hymn (software)|PlayFair]] – created by an anonymous author – also appeared. It can remove the encryption from files using the FairPlay DRM mechanism. The author of Playfair used the source code written by Jon Johansen for VLC. Apple's legal department forced PlayFair to be first removed from [[SourceForge.net]], and then when the Indian open source web site [[Sarovar.org]] hosted the project they too were sent a [[cease and desist]] by Apple's lawyers. However, Playfair's successor [[Hymn (software)|Hymn]] (a [[backronym]] for &quot;'''H'''ear '''Y'''our '''M'''usic a'''N'''ywhere&quot;) has become [[JHymn]], a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] variant of the program, and iOpener, a Windows variant. 

Apple Computer introduced iTunes 6.0 in October 2005, which included changes intended to stop programs like JHymn from decrypting FairPlay encrypted files. Furthermore, once iTunes 6 has been used to purchase songs or authorize a computer with a particular iTMS account, that account will be blocked from making purchases or activations on earlier iTunes versions, thus JHymn can no longer be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hymn-project.org/jhymndoc/ |title=JHymn Info and Help |publisher=Hymn-project.org |author=DRM |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple Computer introduced iTunes 7.0 in September 2006, which once again included changes intended to stop programs similar to JHymn.

===Harmony: RealPlayer Music on the iPod===
In July 2004, [[RealNetworks]] introduced their Harmony technology. The Harmony technology is built into [[RealPlayer]] and allows users of the [[RealPlayer Music Store]] to play their songs on the [[iPod]]. Before the introduction of Harmony this was not possible, because the RealPlayer Music Store uses a different DRM scheme, called [[Helix DRM]], that was incompatible with that used by Apple. While using RealPlayer to transfer a Helix DRM-restricted song onto the iPod, Harmony transparently converts it to a FairPlay-compatible protected file.  Real argued that Harmony was a boon to consumers that &quot;frees&quot; them &quot;from the limitation of being locked into a specific portable device when they buy digital music.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realnetworks.com/company/press/releases/2004/harmony.html |title=RealNetworks Introduces Harmony, Enabling Consumers to Buy Digital Music that Plays on All Popular Devices |publisher=Realnetworks.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple responded:

:We are stunned that RealNetworks has adopted the tactics and ethics of a [[software cracking|hacker]] to break into the iPod, and we are investigating the implications of their actions under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] and other laws. We strongly caution Real and their customers that when we update our iPod software from time to time it is highly likely that Real's Harmony technology will cease to work with current and future iPods.

RealNetworks launched an [[internet petition]] titled &quot;Hey Apple! Don't break my iPod&quot;, encouraging iPod users to sign up to support Real's action. The petition backfired badly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hardware.silicon.com/storage/0,39024649,39123271,00.htm |title=Real v Apple music war: iPod freedom petition backfires - Hardware - Breaking Business and Technology News at silicon.com |publisher=Hardware.silicon.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of posters reacted negatively. The main points of criticism against Harmony were:
* Many posters accused RealNetworks of [[astroturfing]] with the petition they had created.
* RealNetworks was criticised for hypocrisy in keeping its own intellectual property and products closed, while asking Apple to open up the iPod.
* The move was also denounced as an attempt to force Apple into a partnership that would only benefit RealNetworks.

Apple did disable Harmony around the time of the [[iPod photo]] launch, and to older versions shortly after in firmware updates. The change makes it so that all music (past and present) purchased through the [[RealPlayer Music Store]] will not work on Apple's [[iPod]]. In response, Real said they would get it working again.

In August 2005, an [[SEC filings|SEC filing]] by RealNetworks disclosed that continued use of the Harmony technology put themselves at considerable risk because of the possibility of a [[lawsuit]] from Apple, which would be expensive to defend against, even if the court agreed that the technology is legal.  Additionally, the possibility that &quot;Apple will continue to modify its technology to 'break' the interoperability that Harmony provides to consumers&quot; would mean that &quot;Harmony may no longer work with Apple's products, which could harm our business and reputation, or we may be forced to incur additional development costs to refine Harmony to make it interoperate again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1228 |title=AppleInsider &amp;#124; Real admits risk of Apple lawsuit |publisher=Appleinsider.com |author=AppleInsider Staff |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Harmony never resurfaced as an option by RealNetworks.

===Requiem===

Requiem was originally released by &quot;Brahms&quot; as version 1.0 in February 2008, and version 1.8.17 was released in early 2010.   Requiem allows a person to decrypt both music and movies that they are authorized to play in iTunes by reverse-engineering Apple's FairPlay algorithm. Requiem does not remove identification tags from songs. However, there are other methods to remove them.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://www.ghacks.net/2009/02/25/how-to-anonymize-itunes-songs/ |title=Removing private data from iTunes songs |accessdate=2009-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Requiem works by decrypting the iTunes configuration files that are in &quot;/Users/Shared/SC Info&quot;.    In Mac OS X, the key to decrypt these config files is an obfuscated version of the [[MAC address]] of one's computer. In Windows, an amalgamation of hard drive volume information and registry keys are used instead of the MAC address. The initialization variable for this decryption is a [[hard coding|hard coded]] constant. The program then decrypts the keys in the config files as well as the private atoms in the audio/video files and creates unencrypted versions.&lt;ref&gt;Requiem 1.7.3 README file&lt;/ref&gt; An updated [[iTunes version history|iTunes 7.6.2]] disabled Requiem, however, versions 1.4 and 1.5 again circumvented the protection. Apple again disabled Requiem with [[iTunes version history|iTunes 8]], but the author released version 1.8.2 which circumvents iTunes 8 DRM on Mac OS and Microsoft Windows systems. Apple responded by releasing iTunes 8.0.2, which again disabled Requiem.

Apple has taken steps to remove references to Requiem from the JHymn forums.  A [http://hymn-project.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=17241#17241 post on the JHymn forums] explains Apple's [[cease and desist]] order against the forum regarding posting information on circumvention technologies like Requiem.  Since the C&amp;D order, the author of Requiem initially made it available with source code on the anonymous [[Freenet]] network, but then moved it to a [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] [[Tor (anonymity network)#Hidden services|hidden service]]. From there it has been copied onto popular [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] public trackers, such as [[The Pirate Bay]].

On March 16, 2009, the day that iTunes 8.1 was released {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, Requiem was updated several times, ending up with version 1.8.8.  Requiem 1.8.8 decrypts files with iTunes 8.1.0.51, but, as before, Apple responded by releasing iTunes 8.1.0.52, which appears to again disable Requiem. As of May 5, 2009, Requiem 1.8.10 decrypts files with iTunes 8.1.1. On January 5, 2010, Requiem 1.8.16 was released for iTunes 9.0.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tag3ulp55xczs3pn.tor2web.com/ |title=Requiem |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 21, 2010, Requiem 1.8.17 was released for iTunes 9.0.2 as a bug-fix to process files with a size greater than 4GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tag3ulp55xczs3pn.tor2web.com/ |title=Requiem |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent version is 2.0.1, for iTunes 10. Version 2.0 and beyond require use of an iPod, iPhone, or iPad to decrypt music. Apple plans to have iTunes update the DRM coding on videos bought from the iTunes Store automatically by checking the files to see if the coding is up to date.
Requiem 3.1 was released for Mac only, and does away with the need for an iOS device. It has been updated to version 3.3 to support iTunes 10.5.3.

===Conversion to analog===
There are mainly two other methods to bypass the DRM control. The first method is to burn a copy to an audio CD—either real or virtual—and then [[Ripping|rip]] it. 

The second method is to use a recording software and sound card, using the so-called &quot;[[analog hole]]&quot;, for example, Replay Music which records and also identifies and tags the songs using an audio fingerprinting algorithm.

==Steve Jobs' ''Thoughts on Music'' open letter==
On February 6, 2007, [[Steve Jobs]], CEO of Apple Inc., published an open letter entitled ''Thoughts on Music'' on the Apple website calling on the &quot;big four&quot; music companies to sell their music without DRM.&lt;ref name=openletter&gt;{{cite web | url=http://replay.web.archive.org/20080517114107/http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic | title=Thoughts on Music | last=Jobs | first=Steve | date=2007-02-06 | accessdate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Jobs, Apple does not want to use DRM but is forced by the four major musical labels with whom Apple negotiates contracts for iTunes. Jobs's main points were:

* DRM has never and will never be perfect. Hackers will always find a method to break DRM.
* DRM restrictions only hurt people using music legally. Illegal users aren't affected by DRM.
* The restrictions of DRM encourage users to obtain unrestricted music which is usually only possible via illegal methods.
* The vast majority of music is sold without DRM via CDs which has proven successful.

Jobs' letter was met with some praise but many others criticized Apple's hypocritical approach to DRM. While openly criticizing DRM, Apple has been actively threatening or suing anybody trying to open their own DRM or make it interoperable. Critics claim that this is not because Apple is afraid of illegal copies but because it gives them an advantage in their market position as a leader in both electronic music sales (iTunes) and in music players (iPod), reinforcing each other due to the FairPlay DRM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2007/02/09/an-open-letter-to-steve-jobs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=6012 DailyTech - DVD Jon Responds to Steve Jobs' DRM Address&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boingboing.net/2006/03/22/apples-hypocritical-.html Apple's hypocritical slam against French DRM-interop law - Boing Boing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kareldonk.com/karel/2007/02/17/drm-in-trouble-and-windows-vista-sales-lacking/ Karel Donk's Blog » Blog Archive » DRM in trouble and Windows Vista sales lacking&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selected responses to ''Thoughts on Music''===
The essay caused ripples across the music industry, prompting replies from other major players. Responses include those from [[Jon Lech Johansen]] on February 6, [[MP3.com]] founder [[Michael Robertson (businessman)|Michael Robertson]] on February 8, Warner Music boss [[Edgar Bronfman, Jr.|Edgar Bronfman]] and the open DRM [[Coral Consortium]] on February 9, head of [[LAUNCHcast|Yahoo Music]] Dave Goldberg on February 11, Fred Amoroso of [[Macrovision]] on February 16 and the [[Free Software Foundation]] on March 7.

====DVD Jon====
The famous decoder of the [[Content Scramble System]], [[Jon Lech Johansen]], criticized Jobs' statistical evidence that users are not locked into using the [[iPod]] by using the [[iTunes Store]] to download music with [[Apple Computer]]'s FairPlay (DRM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nanocrew.net/2007/02/06/steves-misleading-statistics/ |title=nanocr.eu » Blog Archive » Steve’s misleading statistics |publisher=Nanocrew.net |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Warner Music Group Corp.'s Edgar Bronfman====
In a conference call on the earnings of [[Warner Music Group Corp.]], CEO Edgar Bronfman argued in favour of DRM, claiming that DRM and interoperability are not mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.seekingalpha.com/article/26496 |title=Warner Music Group F1Q07 (Qtr End 12/31/06) Earnings Call Transcript - Seeking Alpha |publisher=Media.seekingalpha.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coral Consortium====
A multi-industry group working on creating interoperability between DRM formats, the [[Coral Consortium]] responded with an invitation to incorporate their technical specifications for interoperability into the iTunes framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coral-interop.org/20070209_Coral_Letter.html |title=Welcome to Coral Consortium |publisher=Coral-interop.org |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yahoo's Dave Goldberg====
In the [[Silicon Valley Watcher]], [[Tom Foremski]] interviewed [[Yahoo Music]] head [[Dave Goldberg]], who advocated removing DRM from music altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2007/02/yahoo_exec_says.php |title=Yahoo exec says removing DRM from music boosts sales |publisher=Siliconvalleywatcher.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Macrovision's Fred Amoroso====
CEO and President of [[Macrovision Corporation]] Fred Amoroso posted his own open letter in response to Steve Jobs's. In his reply, Amoroso argued that DRM increases both consumer value and electronic distribution by giving users choices (e.g. rent vs. buy). He also argues in favor of interoperable and &quot;open&quot; DRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrovision.com/company/1430_5331.htm |title=Article &amp; Reviews - Macrovision |publisher=Macrovision.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-13}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==iTunes Store DRM changes==
===EMI music made available DRM-free===

On April 2, 2007, Steve Jobs and [[EMI]] announced DRM-free music for EMI's complete music library for a 30¢ premium above the standard price. This began in May 2007. Soon after, [[Amazon.com]] began selling unrestricted music files for 99¢ and Apple dropped the price of its DRM free music back to 99¢.

===Announcement of FairPlay restrictions removal===
On 6 January 2009 Apple announced at the 2009 [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo]] that they had reached an agreement with major record labels to sell all music on the iTunes Store free of DRM restrictions. Eight million tracks were available with FairPlay restrictions removed from that day&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7813527.stm Apple to end music restrictions], ''[[BBC News]]'', 7 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; with the remainder of the music store to be DRM-free by the end of March 2009. However, movies, [[iBooks|books]], and television shows purchased from the iTunes Store still contain FairPlay restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/137946/2009/01/itunestore.html |title=iTunes Store goes DRM-free |accessdate=2009-02-10 |last=Cohen |first=Peter |date=2009-01-07 |work=Macworld |publisher=Mac Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Apple IIe''' is the third model in the [[Apple II series]] of personal computers produced by [[Apple Computer]]. The ''e'' in the name stands for ''enhanced'', referring to the fact that several popular features were now built-in that were only available as upgrades and add-ons in earlier models. It also improved upon expandability and added a few new features, which, all combined, made it very attractive to first-time computer shoppers as a general-purpose machine. The Apple IIe has the distinction of being the longest-lived computer in Apple's history, having been manufactured and sold for nearly 11 years with relatively few changes.

==History==
[[Image:Apple iie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Apple IIe with [[Disk_II#DuoDisk|DuoDisk]] and [[Apple Monitor II|Monitor II]].]]

===The beginning===
Apple had planned to retire the Apple II series after the introduction of the [[Apple III]] in 1980; after that machine turned out to be a disastrous failure, management decided the further continuation of the Apple II was in the company's best interest. So after three and a half years at a stand-still, came the introduction of a new Apple II model&amp;nbsp;— the Apple IIe (codenamed &quot;Diana&quot; and &quot;Super II&quot;). The Apple IIe was released in January 1983, the successor to the [[Apple II Plus]]. Some of the hardware and software features of the Apple III were borrowed in the design of the Apple IIe. The culmination of these changes led to increased sales and greater market share of both home and small business use.

===Overview of new features===
One of the most notable improvements of the Apple IIe is the addition of a full [[ASCII]] character set and keyboard. The most important addition is the ability to input and display lower-case letters. Other keyboard improvements include four-way directional cursor control and standard editing keys (Delete and Tab), two special Apple modifier keys (Open and Solid Apple), and a safe off-to-side relocation of the &quot;Reset&quot; key. The auto-repeat function (any key held down to repeat same character continuously) is now automatic, no longer requiring the &quot;REPT&quot; key (now gone) found on the previous model's keyboard.

The machine came standard with 64&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] [[RAM]], with the equivalent of a built-in Apple Language Card in its circuitry, and had a new special &quot;Auxiliary slot&quot; (replacing slot-0, though electronically mapped to slot-3 for compatibility with earlier third-party 80-column cards) for adding more memory via bank-switching RAM cards. Through this slot it also includes built-in support for an 80-column text display on monitors (with the addition of a plug-in 1&amp;nbsp;K memory card, via bank-switching of 40 columns) and could be easily doubled to 128&amp;nbsp;KB RAM by alternatively plugging in an Apple's Extended 80 Columns Card. As time progressed, even more memory could be added through third party cards using the same bank-switching slot, or alternatively general purpose slot cards that addressed memory 1 byte at a time (i.e. Slinky RAM cards). A new ROM diagnostic routine could be invoked to test the motherboard for faults and its main bank of memory.

The Apple IIe lowered production costs and improved reliability by merging the function of several off-the-shelf ICs into single custom chips, reducing total chip count to 31 (previous models used 120 chips). For this reason the motherboard design is much cleaner and runs cooler as well, with enough room to add a pin-connector for an (optional) external numeric keypad. Also added was a backport accessible DE-9 joystick connector, making it far easier for users to add and remove game and input devices (previous models requiring plugging the joystick/paddles directly into a 16-pin DIP socket on the motherboard; the IIe retained this connector for backwards compatibility). Also improved were port openings for expansion cards. Rather than cutout V-shaped slot openings as in the Apple II and II Plus, the IIe has a variety of different sized openings, with thumb-screw holes, to accommodate mounting interface cards with DB-xx and DE-xx connectors (removable plastic covers filled the cutouts if not used). The Apple IIe maintains a high degree of backwards compatibility with the previous two Apple II models, allowing most hardware and software from those systems to be used.

==Revisions==
In production from January 1983 to November 1993, the Apple IIe remained relatively unchanged through the years. However there was one significant motherboard update, a major firmware update, two cosmetically revised machines and an official compatibility solution from Apple, in the form of an LC PDS card for certain models of the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computer line, known as the [[Apple IIe Card]]. These revisions are detailed below.

===The Revision A motherboard===
At the time of the Apple IIe's introduction, and well into the first few months of production, this motherboard shipped with all units. Graphics modes supported are identical, and limited to, that of the Apple II Plus before it. The logic board is not compatible with the ROM based firmware update (introduced some years later) and most newer plug in expansion slot cards.

===The Revision B motherboard===
Shortly after the &quot;Revision A&quot; motherboard's release in 1983, engineers discovered that the bank-switching feature (which used a paralleled 64 KB of RAM on the Extended 80 Columns Card; or 1 KB to produce 80 columns using bank-switching) could also be used to produce a new graphics mode, Double-High-Resolution, with double the horizontal resolution and number of colors of standard High-Resolution. In order to support this, some modifications had to be made to the motherboard, which became the Revision B. In addition to supporting Double-High-Resolution and Double-Low-Resolution (see list above) it also added a special video signal accessible in slot-7.
[[Image:Apple IIe left keys photo.png|right|thumb|200px|New keyboard, with smaller superscripted black print. Note the user-added ''Enhanced'' badge.]]

Apple upgraded the motherboard free of charge. In later years Apple labeled newer IIe motherboards with a &quot;-A&quot; suffix once again, although in functionality they were Revision B motherboards.

===New case and keyboard===
In 1984, Apple revised the case and keyboard. The original IIe uses a case very similar to the Apple II Plus, painted and with [[Velcro]]-type clips to secure the lid with a strip of metal mesh along the edge to eliminate [[Radio frequency interference|Radio Frequency Interference]]. The new case is made of dyed plastic mold in a slightly darker beige with a simplified snap-case lid. The other noticeable change is a new keyboard, with more professional looking print on darker keycaps (small black lettering, versus large white print). This was the first cosmetic change.

===The Enhanced IIe===
In March 1985, Apple replaced the original machine with a new revision called the Enhanced IIe. It is completely identical to the previous machine except for 4 chips changed on the motherboard (and a small &quot;''Enhanced''&quot; or &quot;''65C02''&quot; sticker placed over the keyboard power indicator). The purpose of the update was to make the Apple IIe more compatible with the [[Apple IIc]] (released the previous year) and in some respects to a smaller degree, the Apple II Plus. This change involved a new processor, the CMOS based [[65C02]] CPU, a new character ROM for the text modes, and two new ROM firmware chips. The [[65C02]] added more CPU instructions, the new character ROM added 32 special &quot;[[MouseText]]&quot; characters (which allowed the creation of a [[GUI]]-like display in text mode, similar to IBM [[code page 437]]), and the new ROM firmware fixed problems and speed issues with 80 columns text, introduced the ability to use lowercase in [[Applesoft BASIC]] and Monitor, and contained some other smaller improvements (and fixes) in the latter two (including the return of the [[Apple II Mini-Assembler|Mini-Assembler]]—which had vanished with the introduction of the II Plus firmware).

Although it affected compatibility with a small number of software titles (particularly those that did not follow Apple programming guidelines and rules, used [[illegal opcode]]s that were no longer available in the new CPU, or used the alternate 80-column character set that MouseText now occupied) a fair bit of newer software&amp;nbsp;— mostly productivity applications and utilities&amp;nbsp;— required the Enhancement chipset to run at all. An official upgrade kit, consisting of these four replacement chips and an &quot;Enhanced&quot; sticker badge, was made available for purchase to owners of the original Apple IIe. An alternative at the time, which some users choose as a cost-cutting measure, was to simply purchase their own 65C02 CPU and create (unlicensed and illegal) duplicates of the updated ROMs using re-rewritable [[EPROM]] chips. When Apple phased out the Enhancement kit in the early 1990s, this became the only available method for users looking to upgrade their IIe, and remains so right up until present day. An Enhanced machine identifies itself with the name &quot;Apple //e&quot; on its start up splash screen (as opposed to the less specific &quot;Apple ][&quot;).

===The Platinum IIe===
[[Image:Apple Platinum IIe.jpg|thumb|right|The Platinum Apple IIe with numeric keypad]]

In January 1987 came the final revision of the Apple IIe, often referred to as the Platinum IIe, due to the color change of its case to the light-grey color scheme that Apple dubbed &quot;Platinum&quot;. Changes to this revision were mostly cosmetic to modernize the look of the machine. Besides the color change, there was a new keyboard layout with built-in numeric keypad. The keyboard was changed to match the layout of the [[Apple IIGS]], with the reset key moved above the ESC and '1' keys, the Open and Solid Apple modifier keys replaced by [[Command key|Command]] and Option and the power LED relocated above the numeric keypad. Gone were the recessed metal ID badges (showing the Apple logo and name, with &quot;//e&quot;  beside it) replaced with a simpler &quot;Apple IIe&quot; silk screened on the case lid in the Apple [[Garamond]] font. A smaller Apple logo badge remained, which was moved to the right side of the case.

Internally, a (reduced in size) Extended 80 Columns Card was factory pre-installed, making it come standard with 128&amp;nbsp;KB RAM and Double-Hi-Res graphics enabled. The motherboard has a reduced chip count by merging the two system ROM chips into one and used higher density memory chips so its 64&amp;nbsp;KB RAM could be made up of two (64 Kbx4) chips rather than eight (64 Kbx1) chips, bringing the count down to a total of 24 chips. A solder pad location on the motherboard, present since the original IIe, for (optionally) making presses of the &quot;Shift&quot; keys detectable in software, is now shorted by default so that the feature is always active. Next, in a move to reduce [[Radio frequency interference|Radio Frequency Interference]] when a joystick plugs into the motherboard's Game I/O socket, filtering [[capacitor]]s were added. While this made no difference to the average user, it had the negative effect of lowering the available [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] to the socket, which is often used by specialized devices for such purposes as measuring temperature, controlling a robotic device, or even simplistic networking for data transfer to another computer. In such cases the specialized devices were rendered useless on the Platinum IIe unless the user removed the capacitors from the board.

There were no firmware changes present, and functionally the motherboard is otherwise identical to the Enhanced IIe. This final model of the Apple IIe was discontinued in November 1993, officially retiring the entire Apple II family line with it.

==The Apple IIe Card for Macintosh==
{{Main|Apple IIe Card}}

In March 1991, shortly after the release of the [[Macintosh LC]] series, Apple released the [[Processor Direct Slot|PDS]] slot-based [[Apple IIe Card]] for the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]. By plugging this card into a Macintosh LC (and later models incorporating an LC PDS slot), through hardware and (some) software emulation, the Macintosh can run most software written for the 8-bit Apple IIe computer. This miniaturized computer on a card was made possible by a chip called the [[Mega II]], first used in the [[Apple IIGS]] computer to emulate the Apple IIe. &lt;!--[[Image:PDS_Apple_IIe_Card.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Apple IIe Card for Macintosh.]]--&gt; The Mega II duplicates all the functions of a standard Apple IIe, minus RAM, ROM and CPU.

Many of the built-in Macintosh peripherals can be &quot;borrowed&quot; by the card when in Apple II mode (i.e. extra RAM, 3{{frac|1|2}} floppy, AppleTalk networking, clock, hard disk). It can run at an accelerated 2&amp;nbsp;MHz. As video is emulated using Macintosh [[QuickDraw]] routines, it sometimes can not keep up with the speed of a real Apple IIe in slower machines. With a specialized [[Y-cable]], the card can use an actual Apple 5.25, [[Macintosh External Disk Drive#Apple UniDisk 3.5|Apple UniDisk 3.5]] or even Apple II joystick/paddles. The Apple IIe Card is thought of as an Apple II compatibility solution or [[emulator]] rather than an extension of the Apple II line.

==International versions==
The Apple IIe keyboard differed depending on what region of the world it was sold in. Sometimes the differences were very minor, such as extra local language characters and symbols printed on certain keycaps (e.g. French accented characters on Canadian IIe such as &quot;á&quot;, &quot;é&quot;, &quot;ç&quot;, etc., or the British Pound &quot;£&quot; symbol on the UK IIe) while other times the layout and shape of keys greatly differed (e.g. European IIe). In order to access the local character set and keyboard layout, a user-accessible switch is found on the underside of the keyboard&amp;nbsp;— flipping it will instantly switch the video output and keyboard input from the US character set to the local set. To support this, special double capacity video and keyboard ROMs are used; in early motherboards they had to reside on a tiny circuit card that plugged into the socket. In some countries these localized IIe's also support 50&amp;nbsp;Hz PAL video instead of the standard 60&amp;nbsp;Hz NTSC video and the different 220/240 volt power of that region. An equivalent of the &quot;PAL color card&quot; for the earlier [[Apple II europlus]] model was integrated into the motherboard of these IIe's, so that color graphics are available without the addition of a slot card.

Another difference with the European IIe, is the Auxiliary slot physically moved in location so it is in line and in front of slot-3, preventing both slots from being used simultaneously for full-sized cards. A few third-party cards are affected by this: some European cards plug into both slots simultaneously and are thus unusable on American IIe's, and some American cards that don't fit into the case of European IIe's because the European location of the Auxiliary slot leaves less room for them.

==Upgrades==
===The Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; Upgrade===
[[File:IIGS upgrade markings.jpg|thumb|300px|The replacement ID badges for the front lid, used in the Apple IIe to IIGS upgrade.]]
{{Main|Apple IIGS}}

When the [[Apple IIGS]] computer was introduced by Apple Computer in September 1986, Apple also announced it would be making an upgrade kit for the IIe available for purchase. Essentially the &quot;upgrade&quot; replaced the Apple IIe motherboard for a 16-bit Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; motherboard, making it more of an outright computer transplant than upgrade. Users would bring their Apple IIe machines into an authorized Apple dealership, where the IIe motherboard and lower baseboard of the case were swapped for an Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; motherboard with a new baseboard (with matching cut-outs for the new built-in ports). New metal sticker ID badges replaced those on the front of the Apple IIe, rebranding the machine. Retained were the upper half of the IIe case, the keyboard, speaker and power supply. Original II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt; motherboards (those produced between 1986 to mid 1989) have electrical connections for the IIe power supply and keyboard present, although only about half produced have the physical plug connectors factory pre-soldered in, which were mostly reserved for the upgrade kits.

The upgrade cost US$500, plus the trade-in of the user's existing Apple IIe motherboard and baseplate (and in some cases, the upper half of the IIe case itself for very early Apple IIe units which couldn't accommodate the new baseplate).
[[Image:IIe to IIGS upgrade ports.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Back view of IIGS upgrade, note the new port openings and connectors.]]

It proved unpopular as it did not include a mouse (which is an essential part of the IIGS, much like the Macintosh); the keyboard, although functional, does not mimic all the features and functions of the Apple Desktop Bus keyboard, as well as lacking a numeric keypad; and some cards designed for the new 16-bit machine did not fit in the Apple IIe's slanted case either. In the end most users found they were not saving much, once they had to purchase a 3.5-inch floppy drive, analog RGB monitor and mouse. Although it could use some IIe peripherals, most of them became obsolete in the upgrade due to their function being already built-in. It did make an attractive upgrade for Apple IIe users wanting to use the machine strictly in IIe-emulation mode (ignoring the native part of the machine), which provided faster CPU operation, 256&amp;nbsp;KB RAM, a clock and many built-in peripherals via the back ports.

==Artistic Usage==

The Apple IIe was used by several rock bands for album and music video graphics.  [[Yes (band)|Yes]] used an Apple IIe to create the cover of their ''[[90125]]'' album.  [[Fishbone]] created their self-titled debut EP logo on an Apple IIe.  [[The Residents]] used one to create the graphics on their ''Mole Show'' home video release, as well as the ''[[It's a Man's Man's Man's World]]'' music video.

[[File:Gregoire Apple Cup.jpg|thumb|[[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] governor [[Chris Gregoire]] prepares to present the Apple Cup to the winner of the 2007 Apple Cup.]]

The '''Apple Cup''' is the [[trophy]] awarded to the winner of an American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] game played annually by the teams of the two largest universities in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]: the [[University of Washington]] (UW) [[Washington Huskies football|Huskies]] and the [[Washington State University]] (WSU) [[Washington State Cougars football|Cougars]].  It is traditionally the final game of the regular season and takes place on the Saturday preceding [[Thanksgiving]] at [[Husky Stadium]] in [[Seattle]] during odd years, and WSU's [[Martin Stadium]] in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]] during even years, but with college football season extending, the game is often played at a later date.

==Series history==
From 1950 to 1980 (except for 1954), the WSU home games in the series were played at [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane's]] [[Joe Albi Stadium]]. The WSU Cougars won three of these fifteen games in Spokane (1958, 1968, 1972), and have won six of the fourteen played at [[Martin Stadium]] (1982, 1988, 1992, 1994, 2004, 2008).

Before 1962, the teams played for the &quot;Governor's Trophy.&quot; The game was renamed the &quot;Apple Cup&quot; in 1962 because of Washington's famous apple crop.  The Apple Cup trophy has been awarded to the winning team ever since.

With the lengthening of the college football regular season schedule to 12 games in 2006, there was a movement to change the date of the Apple Cup from the weekend before [[Thanksgiving]] to the weekend following.  This would have allowed a bye week during the season. In the 2006 season, both teams played 12 straight weeks without a break, leaving the two teams noticeably fatigued.  For the first time, the 2007 edition of the Apple Cup was played two days after Thanksgiving.

The Apple Cup has been sponsored by [[Boeing]] since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gohuskies.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/090607aac.html &quot;Boeing To Present Apple Cup.&quot;] Gohuskies.com. September 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first rivalry game was held in 1900 and resulted in a tie between UW and WSU.  From 1900 to 2011, there have been 104 games between the schools. The Huskies were the home team 58 times (all in Seattle). The Cougars were the home team 46 times (31 in Pullman, 15 in Spokane). The Huskies hold a 67–31–6 advantage. The UW's longest winning streak has been eight games, achieved twice: (1959–66 and 1974–81). WSU has never won more than two consecutive Apple Cups, but the Cougars have won back-to-back games on eight separate occasions: (1929–30, 1953–54, 1957–58, 1967–68, 1972–73, 1982–83, 2004–05 and 2007–08).

Washington currently holds the trophy for three straight years. In 2009, the Cougars were shut out 30–0 at Husky Stadium, UW's first shutout since 1964. In 2010, the Huskies defeated the Cougars 35-28.  The 104th and most recent Apple Cup on November 26, 2011 was won 38-21 by UW, playing at [[CenturyLink Field]] in [[Seattle]] due to renovations at [[Husky Stadium]].

The '''Apple IIc''', the fourth model in the [[Apple II series]] of personal computers, was [[Apple Computer]]’s first endeavor to produce a [[portable computer]]. The end result was a {{convert|7.5|lb|kg|abbr=on}} notebook-sized version of the Apple II that could be transported from place to place. The ''c'' in the name stood for ''compact'', referring to the fact it was essentially a complete Apple II computer setup (minus display and power supply) squeezed into a small notebook-sized housing. While sporting a built-in floppy drive and new rear peripheral expansion ports integrated onto the main [[logic board]], it lacked the internal [[expansion slots]] and direct motherboard access of earlier Apple IIs, making it a closed system like the [[Macintosh]]. However, that was the intended direction for this model — a more appliance-like machine, ready to use out of the box, requiring no technical know-how or experience to hook up and therefore attractive to first-time users.

==History==
The Apple IIc was released on April 24th, 1984, during an Apple-held event called ''Apple II Forever''. The new machine was proclaimed as proof of Apple’s long-term commitment to the Apple II series and its users, an assurance the company’s older technology would not be forsaken or dropped with the recent introduction of the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]]. Beyond displaying a commitment to the vitality of the Apple II line, the IIc was also seen as the company's response to [[IBM]]'s new [[PCjr]].&lt;ref name=&quot;miller198407&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n7/116_Apple_announces_the_IIc.php | title=Apple announces the IIc | accessdate=2011-03-17 | author=Miller, George A. | date=1984-07 | publisher=Creative Computing | pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; While essentially an [[Apple IIe]] computer in a smaller case, it was not a successor, but rather a portable version to complement it. One Apple II machine would be sold for users who required the expandability of slots, and another for those wanting the simplicity of a [[plug and play]] machine with portability in mind.

The machine introduced Apple’s [[Snow White design language]], notable for its case styling and a modern look which soon became the standard for most Apple equipment and computers, and continued for nearly a decade after. The Apple IIc introduced a unique off-white coloring known as “Fog,” chosen to enhance the Snow White design style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/apple2/bytema84.pdf The Apple IIc Personal Computer] A portable IIe compatible that runs ProDOS. John Markoof – BYTE Senior Technical Editor – May 1984 (Page 276–282) – BYTE magazine&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple IIc, along with a few other peripherals, was the only computer made by Apple to use the &quot;Fog&quot; coloring.&lt;ref&gt;Kunkel, Paul, “AppleDesign: The work of the Apple Industrial Design Group,” with photographs by Rick English, New York: Graphis, 1997, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; While relatively light-weight and compact in design, the Apple IIc was not a true portable in design as it lacked a built-in battery and display.

Codenames for the machine while under development included: Lollie, ET, Yoda, Teddy, VLC, IIb, IIp.

==Overview of features==

===Improving the IIe===
Technically the Apple IIc was an [[Apple IIe]] computer in a smaller case, retaining the same set of features. Building on the design, it did manage to offer a few minor improvements without affecting compatibility for the most part. It utilized the CMOS-based [[65C02]] microprocessor (instead of a plain 6502) which added 27 new processor instructions and drew less power (but hampered compatibility with a very small number of programs that used [[illegal opcode]]s of the 6502 processor, which were removed in the 65C02). The new ROM firmware allowed [[Applesoft BASIC]] to recognize lowercase characters and work better with an 80-column display, and fixed several bugs from the IIe ROM. In terms of video, the text display added 32 unique character symbols called “[[MouseText]]” which, when placed side by side, could display simplistic looking icons, windows and menus to recreate a [[graphical user interface]] completely out of text, similar in concept to IBM [[ANSI]] or [[PETSCII]]. A year later, the Apple IIe would benefit from these improvements in the form of a four-chip upgrade called the [[Apple IIe#The Enhanced IIe|Enhanced IIe]].

===Built-in cards and ports===
The equivalent of five slot cards were built-in and integrated into the Apple IIc motherboard. These included: an Extended 80 Column Card, two Apple [[Apple II serial cards|Super Serial Cards]], a Mouse Card, and a floppy drive controller card. This meant the Apple IIc had 128&amp;nbsp;KB [[Random access memory|RAM]], 80-column text, and Double-Hi-Resolution graphics built-in and available right out of the box, unlike its older sibling, the Apple IIe. It also meant less of a need for slots, as the most popular peripheral add-on cards were already built-in, ready for devices to be plugged into the rear ports of the machine. The built-in cards were mapped to phantom slots so software from slot-based Apple II models would know where to find them (i.e. mouse to virtual slot 4, serial cards to slot 1 and 2, floppy to slot 6, and so on). Of interest is that the entire Apple Disk II Card, used for controlling floppy drives, had been shrunk down into a single chip called the “IWM” which stood for Integrated Wozniak Machine.

In the rear of the machine were its expansion ports, mostly for providing access to its built-in cards. The standard [[DE-9 connector|DE-9]] joystick connector doubled as a mouse interface, compatible with the same mice used by the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] and early [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers. Two serial ports were provided primarily to support a printer and modem, and a floppy port connector supported a single external 5.25-inch drive (and later “intelligent” devices such as 3.5-inch drives and hard disks). A Video Expansion port provided rudimentary signals for add-on adapters but alone could not directly generate a video signal (Apple produced an LCD display and an RF-modulator for this port; the latter shipped with early IIcs). A port connector tied into an internal 12&amp;nbsp;V power converter for attaching batteries; this is where the infamous external power supply (dubbed “brick on a leash” by users) that was included plugged in. The same composite video port found on earlier Apple II models remained present; however, gone were the cassette ports and internal DIP-16 game port.

===Built-in accessories and keyboard===
The Apple IIc had a built-in 5.25-inch floppy drive (140&amp;nbsp;KB) along the right side of the case—the first Apple II model to include such a feature. Along the left side of the case was a dial to control the volume of the internal speaker, along with a {{frac|1|8}}-inch monaural audio jack for headphones or an external speaker. A fold-out carrying handle doubled as a way to prop up the back end of the machine to angle the keyboard for typing, if desired.

The keyboard layout mirrored that of the Apple IIe; however, the “Reset” key had been moved above the “Esc” key. Two toggle switches were also located in the same area: an “80/40”-column switch for (specially-written) software to detect which text video mode to start up in, and a “Keyboard” switch to select between [[QWERTY]] and [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]] layout—or between US and national layout on non-American machines. The keyboard itself was built into the front half of the case, much like a notebook computer, and had a rubber mat placed beneath the keycaps which acted as a liquid spill guard.

==Revisions==
The Apple IIc was in production from April 1984 to August 1988, and during this time accrued some minor changes. These modifications included three new ROM updates, a bug-fix correction to the original motherboard, a newly revised motherboard, and a slight cosmetic change to the external appearance of the machine. The ROM revision for a specific Apple IIc is determined by entering the Applesoft BASIC programming language and typing in the command ''PRINT PEEK (64447)'' which returns the value indicating the particular ROM version.&lt;ref&gt;''Apple IIC Technical Reference Manual'' New York: Addison-Wesley, 1987, pp. xxiii-xxv / ISBN 0-201-17752-8 / OCLC {{OCLC search link|17806974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original IIc (ROM version ‘255’)===
The initial ROM, installed in machines produced during the first year and a half of production, was 16&amp;nbsp;KB in size. The only device which could be connected to the disk port was (one) external 5.25-inch floppy drive; software could be booted from this external drive by typing the command “PR#7.” The serial port did not mask incoming linefeed characters or support the XON/XOFF protocol, unlike all later firmware revisions to come. There was no self-test diagnostic present in this ROM, holding down the solid-Apple key during cold boot merely cycled unusual patterns on screen which served no useful purpose or indication of the machine’s health.

===Serial port timing fix===
The original Apple IIc motherboard (manufactured between April and November 1984) derived the timing for its two serial ports through a 74LS161 [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] logic chip. It was later found that this method’s timing was 3% slower than the minimum requirement specified and caused some third party (i.e. non-Apple) modems and printers, which operated at 1200 bits per second ([[baud]]) or faster, to function improperly. Slower serial devices operating at 300 baud or less were unaffected, as well as some faster devices which could tolerate the deviation. The solution to ensure all devices were compatible was to replace the TTL chip with an oscillator during manufacture. Apple would swap affected motherboards for users who could prove they had an incompatible serial device (e.g. a third-party 1200-baud modem which presented problems; not all did). It is important to note the problem did not affect all owners; it was more or less a hit-or-miss issue depending on the specific device connected.

===UniDisk 3.5 support (ROM version ‘0’)===
This update, introduced in November 1985, came in the form of an upgrade to the ROM firmware which doubled in size from 16&amp;nbsp;KB to 32&amp;nbsp;KB. The new ROM supported “intelligent” devices such as the [[Macintosh External Disk Drive|Apple UniDisk 3.5]]-inch (800&amp;nbsp;KB) floppy drive, in addition to an external 5.25-inch floppy drive. A new self-test diagnostic was provided for testing built-in [[RAM]] and other signs of logic faults. The Mini-Assembler, absent since the days of the [[Apple II Plus]], made a return, and new Monitor “Step” and “Trace” commands were added as well. The upgraded ROM added rudimentary support for an external AppleTalk networking device which was yet to be developed. When attempting to boot virtual slot 7, users would encounter the message “APPLETALK OFFLINE.” The IIc, however, had no built-in networking capabilities, and no external device was ever released. The upgrade consisted of a single chip swap (and a trivial motherboard modification), which Apple provided free only to persons who purchased a UniDisk 3.5 drive. A small sticker with an icon of a 3.5-inch floppy diskette was placed next to the existing 5.25-inch diskette icon above the floppy drive port indicating the machine had been upgraded.

===Memory Expansion IIc (ROM version ‘3’)===
Introduced in September 1986 simultaneously with the [[Apple IIgs|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]], this model introduced a new motherboard, new keyboard and new color scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=790 Apple IIc (Platinum): Mouse Moved from Slot 4 to Slot 7]&lt;/ref&gt; The original Apple IIc had no expansion options and required third-party cards to perform various hardware tricks. This could be done by removing the CPU and MMU chips and squeezing a special board into these sockets, which then used bank switching to expand memory ([[RAM]]). This was similar to the function of the auxiliary slot in the original Apple IIe. The new motherboard added a 34-pin socket for plugging in memory cards directly, which allowed for the addressing of up to 1&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte]] (MB) of memory using Slinky-type memory cards. The onboard chip count was reduced from 16 memory chips (64K×1) to four (64K×4). The new firmware removed the code for the cancelled AppleTalk networking device and replaced it with support for memory cards. Bumping out the non-supported AppleTalk functionality, memory now lived in virtual slot 4, and mouse support moved to slot 7. The new keyboard no longer had the rubber anti-spill mat and offered  generally more tactile and responsive keys that felt more “clicky.” At the same time, the color of the keyboard, floppy drive latch, and power supply cords changed from beige to light grey, which matched the new Platinum color scheme of the [[Apple IIgs|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]]. The case style, however, remained [[Snow White design language|Snow White]]. Owners of the previous IIc model were entitled to a free motherboard upgrade if they purchased one of Apple’s IIc memory expansion boards (they did not receive the new keyboard or the cosmetic changes).

===Memory Expansion fix (ROM version ‘4’)===
In January 1988, a new ROM firmware update was issued to address bugs in the new memory expandable IIc. Changes included better detection of installed RAM chips, correction of a problem when using the serial modem port in terminal-mode, and a bug fix for keyboard buffering. The ROM upgrade was available free of charge only to owners of the memory expansion IIc. This was the final change to the Apple IIc until superseded by the '''[[Apple IIc Plus]]''' (identified as ROM version ‘5’).

==International versions==
Like the [[Apple IIe]] before it, the Apple IIc keyboard differed depending on what region of the world it was sold in. Sometimes the differences were very minor, such as extra local language characters and symbols printed on certain keycaps (e.g. French accented characters on Canadian IIc such as “á,” “é,” “ç,” etc., or the British Pound “£” symbol on the UK IIc) while other times the layout and shape of keys greatly differed (e.g. European IIc). In order to access the local character set, the “Keyboard” switch above the keyboard was depressed, which would instantly switch text video from the US character set to the local set. The DVORAK keyboard layout was not available on international IIcs&amp;mdash;the feature had been intended to switch between international keyboards; the DVORAK layout was merely added to give the switch a function on US IIcs.  In some countries these localized IIcs also supported 50&amp;nbsp;Hz PAL video and the different 220/240-volt power of that region by means of a different external power supply — this was a very simple change, since the IIc had an internal 12-volt power converter. The international versions replaced any English wording printed on the case (specifically the “keyboard” toggle switch, “Power” and “Disk Use” drive activity labels) with graphical icon symbols that could be universally understood.

==Add-on accessories==
===Portability enhancements===
[[File:Apple IIc with LCD display.jpg|thumb|right|An Apple IIc with the ''Apple Flat Panel Display'' attached]]
At the time of the Apple IIc’s release, Apple announced an optional black and white (1-bit) [[LCD]] screen designed specifically for the machine called the ''Apple Flat Panel Display''. While it was welcomed as a means of making the IIc more portable, it did not integrate well as a portable solution, not attaching in a secure or permanent manner and not able to fold-over face down. Instead, it sat atop the machine and connected via ribbon cable to a somewhat bulky rear port connector. Its main shortcoming was that it suffered from a very poor contrast and no backlighting, making it very difficult to view without a strong external light source. The display itself had an odd aspect ratio as well, making graphics look vertically squashed. A third-party company would later introduce a work-alike LCD screen called the ''C-Vue'', which looked and functioned very much like Apple’s product, albeit with a reportedly slight improvement in viewability. Consequently, both sold poorly and had a very short market life span, making these displays fairly uncommon (and as a result, extremely rare today).

Third parties also offered external [[rechargeable battery]] units for the Apple IIc (e.g. ''Prairie Pack'') with up to eight hours per charge or longer. Although they aided in making the machine more of a true portable, they were nonetheless bulky and heavy, and added more pieces that would have to be carried. Adapter cables were sold as well that allowed the Apple IIc to plug into an automobile's DC power cigarette lighter.

To help transport the Apple IIc and its accessory pieces around, Apple sold a nylon carrying case with shoulder strap that had a compartment for the computer, its external power supply, and the cables. It had enough room to squeeze in one of the above-mentioned LCD display units. The case was grey in color with a stitched-on Apple logo in the upper left corner.

===Expansion capabilities===
While the Apple IIc had many built-in features to offer, many users wanted to extend the machine’s capabilities beyond what Apple provided. It proved difficult since the IIc was a closed system that initially was designed with no expansion capabilities in mind; however, many companies figured out ingenious ways of squeezing enhancements inside the tiny case. Real-time clocks, memory expansion, and coprocessors were popular, and some companies even managed to combine all three into a single add-on board. Typically, in order to add these options, key chips on the motherboard were pulled and moved onto the expansion board offering the new features, and the board was then placed into the empty sockets. While sometimes a tight squeeze, this trickery worked quite well, and most importantly of all offered users a way to expand memory—something Apple did not themselves support until the Memory Expansion IIc model was introduced.

Some companies devised a method for squeezing in an entire CPU accelerator product, by means of placing all the specialized circuitry (i.e. [[CPU cache|cache]] and logic) into one tall chip that outright replaced the 40-pin 65C02 microprocessor, speeding up the machine from 4–10&amp;nbsp;MHz. Notable examples are the [[Apple II accelerators|Zip Chip and Rocket Chip]].

Although the IIc lacked a SCSI or IDE interface, external hard drives were produced by third parties that connected through the floppy SmartPort as an innovative alternative connection method (e.g. ''ProApp'', ''Chinook'', ''C-Drive''). While these specialized hard drives were relatively slow due to the nature of how data was transferred through this interface (designed primarily for floppy drives) they did allow for true mass storage. Other innovations that used existing expansion ports led to add-on speech and music synthesis products by means of external devices that plugged into the IIc’s serial ports. Two popular such devices were the ''Mockingboard-D'' and ''Echo IIc''.

===General accessories===
For those wishing to use the Apple IIc as a standard desktop machine, Apple sold an optional small {{convert|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} monochrome CRT display with an elevated stand; alternatively, a {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}} color composite monitor could be used. A mouse was another popular add-on, especially since it required no interface card and simply plugged directly into back of the machine ([[MousePaint]], a clone of the popular MacPaint, shipped with the IIc’s mouse). An external 5.25-inch floppy drive, matching the style of the IIc, was also made available. Later, 3.5-inch floppy storage became an option with the “intelligent” UniDisk 3.5 which contained its own miniature computer inside (CPU, RAM, firmware) to overcome the issue of using a high-speed floppy drive on a 1&amp;nbsp;MHz machine.

'''&quot;The Big Apple&quot;''' is a nickname for [[New York City]]. It was first popularized in the 1920s by [[John J. Fitz Gerald]], a sports writer for the ''New York Morning Telegraph''. Its popularity since the 1970s is due to a promotional campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, known now as [[NYC &amp; Company]].

== The nickname of New York ==
Although the history of ''the Big Apple'' was once thought a mystery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_382.html Why is New York called the Big Apple?], [[The Straight Dope]] February 18, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; research over the past two decades, primarily by amateur etymologist [[Barry Popik]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/ The Big Apple]. This web site, owned and maintained by Barry Popik, contains updated information reflecting research by Popik and others and includes the text of significant examples.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gerald Cohen of [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Cohen, ''Origin of [[New York City]]'s Nickname &quot;The Big Apple&quot;'' (1991), ISBN 3631437870.&lt;/ref&gt; has provided a reasonably clear picture of the term's history. Previously, there were a number of false etymologies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/category/C10/ False Etymologies].&lt;/ref&gt; including a claim that the term derived from a New York brothel whose madam was known as Eve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/19971010010804/http://www.salwen.com/apple.html Why Is New York City Called &quot;The Big Apple&quot;?] [[Internet Archive#Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]] archive of earlier version of web page.&lt;/ref&gt; This was subsequently exposed as a hoax&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_whore_hoax_1800s/ Big Apple Whore Hoax (1800s!)].&lt;/ref&gt; and has been replaced on the source web site with more accurate information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salwen.com/apple.html Why Is New York City Called &quot;The Big Apple&quot;?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest citation for &quot;big apple&quot; is the 1909 book ''The Wayfarer in New York,'' by [[Edward Martin]], writing: &quot;Kansas is apt to see in New York a greedy city. . . . It inclines to think that '''the big apple''' gets a disproportionate share of the national sap&quot; (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | first = William | last = Safire | authorlink = William Safire | title = Big Applesource | journal = [[The New York Times Magazine]] | date = September 17, 2000 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/17/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-9-17-00-on-language-slurvian.html?pagewanted=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | first = William | last = Safire | authorlink = William Safire | title = The Right Word in the Right Place at the Right Time | year = 2004 | page = [http://books.google.com/books?id=blcCxBWVdzgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=big%20apple p. 23]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Safire]] considered this the coinage, but the Random House Dictionary of American Slang considers the usage &quot;metaphorical or perhaps proverbial, rather than a concrete example of the later slang term&quot;, and Popik likewise does not consider this the coinage.

''The Big Apple'' was first popularized as a reference to New York City by John J. Fitz Gerald in a number of ''New York Morning Telegraph'' articles in the 1920s in reference to New York horse-racing. The earliest of these was a casual reference on May 3, 1921:

&lt;blockquote&gt;J. P. Smith, with Tippity Witchet and others of the L. T. Bauer string, is scheduled to start for &quot;the big apple&quot; to-morrow after a most prosperous Spring campaign at Bowie and Havre de Grace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/first_big_apple_may_3_1921/ First “Big Apple”: May 3, 1921].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fitz Gerald referred to the &quot;big apple&quot; frequently thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/numerous_1920s_big_apple_citations_in_the_new_york_morning_telegraph/ Numerous 1920s “Big Apple” citations in the New York Morning Telegraph].&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his use in a February 18, 1924, column under the headline &quot;Around the Big Apple&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Big Apple. The dream of every lad that ever threw a leg over a thoroughbred and the goal of all horsemen. There's only one Big Apple. That's New York.

Two dusky stable hands were leading a pair of thoroughbred around the &quot;cooling rings&quot; of adjoining stables at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans and engaging in desultory conversation.

&quot;Where y'all goin' from here?&quot; queried one.

&quot;From here we're headin' for The Big Apple,&quot; proudly replied the other.

&quot;Well, you'd better fatten up them skinners or all you'll get from the apple will be the core,&quot; was the quick rejoinder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/first_big_apple_explanation_february_18_1924/ First “Big Apple” explanation: February 18, 1924]. See also the original article [http://www.barrypopik.com/images/FitzGerald1.gif image].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fitz Gerald's reference to the &quot;dusky&quot; stable hands suggests the term's origin may lie in [[African-American]] culture. Support for this is found in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', an African-American newspaper that had a national circulation. “Ragtime” Billy Tucker, a vaudeville/ragtime performer and writer for the ''Defender'', there used &quot;big apple&quot; to refer to New York in a non-horse-racing context on September 16, 1922:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I trust your trip to 'the big apple' (New York) was a huge success and only wish that I had been able to make it with you.&lt;ref name=&quot;linguistlist_antedating_1920vaudeville&quot;&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0801D&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R9794 &quot;Big Apple&quot; antedating]; [http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/1920s_vaudeville_ragtime_big_apple_citations/ 1920s Vaudeville/Ragtime “Big Apple” Citations].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tucker had earlier used &quot;Big Apple&quot; as a reference to a different city, Los Angeles.  This example, from May 15, 1920, is the earliest known use of &quot;Big Apple&quot; to refer to any city.{{fact|date=October 2011}} &lt;!-- huh? see the 1909 quote earlier in the article --&gt; It is possible that the writer simply understood &quot;Big Apple&quot; as an appropriate nickname for any large city:

By the late 1920s, New York writers other than Fitz Gerald were starting to use &quot;Big Apple&quot; and were using it outside of a horse-racing context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/1920s_non_horseracing_big_apple_citations/ 1920s Non-Horseracing “Big Apple” Citations].&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Big Apple&quot; was a popular song&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_song_by_bob_emmerich/ “Big Apple” song by Bob Emmerich].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Big Apple (dance)|dance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_in_the_1930s_two_clubs_plus_song_and_dance/ “Big Apple” in the 1930s (Two clubs, plus song and dance)].&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1930s.  [[Walter Winchell]] and other writers continued to use the name in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_in_the_1940s_1950s/ “Big Apple” in the 1940s-1950s].&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, &quot;the Big Apple&quot; was known only as an old name for New York.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Vonnegut, ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' 265 (1969; Delta Trade Paperbacks ed. 1999) (&quot;That's what they used to call New York&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, however, the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau (now NYC &amp; Company, the official marketing and tourism organization for New York City),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycvisit.com/content/index.cfm?pagePkey=20 About NYC and Company].&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of its president, Charles Gillett, began promoting &quot;the Big Apple&quot; for the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_1970s_revival_charlie_gillett_and_lew_rudin/ Big Apple 1970s Revival: Charlie Gillett and Lew Rudin].&lt;/ref&gt; It has remained popular since then.&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.voanews.com/a-23-2009-12-24-voa2-84659432.html|title=Words and Their Stories: Nicknames for New York City|date=2010-02-23|work=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor [[Rudolph W. Giuliani]] in 1997 signed legislation designating the southwest corner of West [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] and Broadway, the corner on which John J. Fitz Gerald lived from 1934 to 1963, as &quot;Big Apple Corner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/om/html/97/sp082-97.html Mayor's Press Office, Release No. 082-97, Mayor Giuliani Signs Legislation Creating &quot;Big Apple Corner&quot; in Manhattan (Feb. 12, 1997)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Mets]] have featured a &quot;Home Run Apple&quot; that rises whenever a Mets player hits a home run. It has become a symbol of the Mets baseball team, recognized throughout the league as an iconic feature of the Mets' stadiums. It first appeared in [[Shea Stadium]], and the original can still be seen on display at [[Citi Field]], outside the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. Citifield now uses a new apple, one that is nearly four times the size of the original.

In ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', [[Buenos Aires]] is referred to as &quot;B.A., Buenos Aires, Big Apple&quot; in the song ''Eva, Beware of the City''. This reference was invented by lyricist [[Tim Rice]] and does not reflect preexisting use.
