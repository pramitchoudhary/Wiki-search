In [[biology]], and specifically [[genetics]], '''epigenetics''' is the study of heritable changes in [[gene expression]] or cellular phenotype caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying [[DNA]] sequence – hence the name ''epi-'' (Greek: ''επί''- over, above, outer) ''-[[genetics]]''. It refers to functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence. Examples of such changes are [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation|histone deacetylation]], both of which serve to suppress gene expression without altering the sequence of the silenced genes. 

In 2011, it was demonstrated that the [[methylation]] of [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] has a critical role in human [[energy balance (biology)|energy homeostasis]]. This opened the related field of RNA epigenetics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-10-links-common-rna-modification-obesity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes may remain through [[cell (biology)|cell]] [[mitosis|division]]s for the remainder of the cell's life and may also last for multiple generations. However, there is no change in the underlying [[DNA]] sequence of the organism;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Perceptions of epigenetics| author=Adrian Bird| journal=Nature| volume=447| pages=396–398| year=2007| doi=10.1038/nature05913| issue=7143 | pmid = 17522671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism's genes to behave (or &quot;express themselves&quot;) differently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10140 Special report: 'What genes remember' by Philip Hunter | Prospect Magazine May 2008 issue 146&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of epigenetic changes in [[eukaryotic]] biology is the process of [[cellular differentiation]].  During [[morphogenesis]], [[totipotent]] [[stem cells]] become the various [[pluripotent]] [[cell line]]s of the [[embryo]], which in turn become fully differentiated cells.  In other words, a single fertilized egg cell &amp;ndash; the [[zygote]] &amp;ndash; changes into the many cell types including neurons, muscle cells, epithelium, endothelium of blood vessels, etc. as it continues to [[mitosis|divide]]. It does so by activating some genes while inhibiting others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Reik| first = Wolf| authorlink =| coauthors = | title = Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development| journal = Nature| volume =  447| issue = May (online)| pages = 425–432| publisher =| date = 2007-05-23| pmid = 17522676| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7143/full/nature05918.html| doi = 10.1038/nature05918 | accessdate = 2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of epigenetic change that can be found in animals can be seen in rat pups. It has been found that when rat mothers give birth to their pups they will clean and groom them, which is a form of tactile stimulation. However it seems that not all mothers groom their young the same way, thus causing us to place them into two groups: High LG mothers and Low LG mothers. The high LG mothers groom and lick their young at a much greater rate than the low LG mothers. As a result it was found that the pups of high LG mothers were healthier, grew at a good rate, and were all around much better off than the pups raised by low LG mothers. Therefore it seems that the way rat pups develop is not exactly genetic, but epigenetic. Further research discovered that the licking of the mother triggers the hippocampus in the rat pup, which then stimulates the hypothalamus, which releases CRF that stimulates the pituitary to release ACTH, which finally causes the adrenal to release [[glucocorticoid]]s. This cascade of events all caused by the licking and grooming of the mother causes that pup to have decreased CRF expression in the hypothalamus, reduced ACTH and glucocorticoid responses to acute stress, and significantly increased glucocorticoid receptor expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Tie-Yuan|coauthors=Meaney, Michael|title=Epigenetics and the Environmental Regulation of the Genome and Its Function|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=2010|issue=61|pages=439–466|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163625|url=psych.annualreviews.org|accessdate=04/05/10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and definitions==
[[File:Epigenetic mechanisms.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Epigenetic mechanisms]]
''Epigenetics'' (as in &quot;[[epigenetic landscape]]&quot;) was coined by [[Conrad Hal Waddington|C. H. Waddington]] in 1942 as a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''[[genetics]]'' and ''[[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]]''.&lt;ref name=waddington&gt;{{cite journal|author=C.H. Waddington (1942)| title=The epigenotype| journal=Endeavour| volume=1| pages=18–20|doi=10.1016/0160-9327(77)90005-9|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Epigenesis'' is an old&lt;ref name=OED1&gt;According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]: {{quote | The word is used by W. Harvey, ''Exercitationes'' 1651, p. 148, and in the ''English Anatomical Exercitations'' 1653, p. 272. It is explained to mean ‘partium super-exorientium additamentum’, ‘the additament of parts budding one out of another’.}}  It is also worth quoting this adumbration of the definition given there (viz., &quot;The formation of an organic germ as a new product&quot;): {{quote | '''theory of epigenesis''': the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction. [...] The opposite theory was formerly known as the ‘theory of evolution’; to avoid the ambiguity of this name, it is now spoken of chiefly as the ‘theory of preformation’, sometimes as that of ‘encasement’ or ‘emboîtement’.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; word that has more recently been used (see ''[[preformationism]]'' for historical background) to describe the differentiation of cells from their initial [[totipotent]] state in embryonic development.  When Waddington coined the term the physical nature of genes and their role in heredity was not known; he used it as a conceptual model of how genes might interact with their surroundings to produce a [[phenotype]].

[[Robin Holliday]] defined epigenetics as &quot;the study of the mechanisms of temporal and spatial control of gene activity during the development of complex organisms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Holliday, R., 1990. Mechanisms for the control of gene activity during development. Biol. Rev. Cambr. Philos. Soc. 65, 431-471&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''epigenetic'' can be used to describe anything other than DNA sequence that influences the development of an organism.

The modern usage of the word in scientific discourse is more narrow, referring to heritable traits (over rounds of cell division and sometimes transgenerationally) that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Russo, V.E.A., Martienssen, R.A., Riggs, A.D., 1996 Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek prefix ''epi-'' in ''epigenetics'' implies features that are &quot;on top of&quot; or &quot;in addition to&quot; genetics; thus ''epigenetic'' traits exist on top of or in addition to the traditional molecular basis for inheritance.

The similarity of the word to &quot;genetics&quot; has generated many parallel usages. The &quot;epigenome&quot; is a parallel to the word &quot;[[genome]]&quot;, and refers to the overall epigenetic state of a cell. The phrase &quot;[[genetic code]]&quot; has also been adapted&amp;mdash;the &quot;[[epigenetic code]]&quot; has been used to describe the set of epigenetic features that create different phenotypes in different cells. Taken to its extreme, the &quot;epigenetic code&quot; could represent the total state of the cell, with the position of each molecule accounted for in an ''epigenomic map'', a diagrammatic representation of the gene expression, DNA methylation and histone modification status of a particular genomic region. More typically, the term is used in reference to systematic efforts to measure specific, relevant forms of epigenetic information such as the [[histone code hypothesis|histone code]] or [[DNA methylation]] patterns.

The psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] used the term ''epigenetic''{{When|date=February 2011}} in his theory of [[psychosocial development]]. That usage, however, is of primarily historical interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-definition/Epigenetics|title=Epigenetics|publisher= Bio-Medicine.org|accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular basis of epigenetics==

The molecular basis of epigenetics is complex.  It involves modifications of the activation of certain genes, but not the basic structure of [[DNA]].  Additionally, the [[chromatin]] proteins associated with DNA may be activated or silenced. This accounts for why the differentiated cells in a multi-cellular organism express only the genes that are necessary for their own activity. Epigenetic changes are preserved when cells divide. Most epigenetic changes only occur within the course of one individual organism's lifetime, but, if a mutation in the DNA has been caused in  sperm or egg cell that results in fertilization, then some epigenetic changes are inherited from one generation to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Paramutation: From Maize to Mice| author=V.L. Chandler| journal=Cell| volume=128| pages=641–645| year=2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.007| pmid=17320501| issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the question of whether or not epigenetic changes in an organism can alter the basic structure of its DNA (see Evolution, below), a form of [[Lamarckism]].

Specific epigenetic processes include [[paramutation]], [[bookmarking]], [[Imprinting (genetics)|imprinting]], [[gene silencing]], [[X-inactivation|X chromosome inactivation]], [[position effect]], [[reprogramming]], [[transvection (genetics)|transvection]], [[maternal effect]]s, the progress of [[carcinogenesis]], many effects of [[teratogen]]s, regulation of [[histone]] modifications and [[heterochromatin]], and technical limitations affecting [[parthenogenesis]] and [[cloning]].

Epigenetic research uses a wide range of molecular biologic techniques to further our understanding of epigenetic phenomena, including [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] (together with its large-scale variants [[ChIP-on-chip]] and [[ChIP-Seq]]), [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]], methylation-sensitive [[restriction enzymes]], DNA adenine methyltransferase identification ([[DamID]]) and [[bisulfite sequencing]]. Furthermore, the use of [[bioinformatic]] methods is playing an increasing role ([[computational epigenetics]]).

===DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling===
[[Image:Nucleosome 1KX5 2.png|thumb|DNA associates with histone proteins to form chromatin.]]
Because the [[phenotype]] of a cell or individual is affected by which of its genes are transcribed, heritable [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription states]] can give rise to epigenetic effects. There are several layers of regulation of [[gene expression]].  One way that genes are regulated is through the remodeling of chromatin.  Chromatin is the complex of DNA and the [[histone]] proteins with which it associates.  Histone proteins are little spheres that DNA wraps around.  If the way that DNA is wrapped around the histones changes, gene expression can change as well.  Chromatin remodeling is accomplished through two main mechanisms:
# The first way is [[post translational modification]] of the amino acids that make up histone proteins.  Histone proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids.  If the amino acids that are in the chain are changed, the shape of the histone sphere might be modified. DNA is not completely unwound during replication.  It is possible, then, that the modified histones may be carried into each new copy of the DNA.  Once there, these histones may act as templates, initiating the surrounding new histones to be shaped in the new manner.  By altering the shape of the histones around it, these modified histones would ensure that a differentiated cell would stay differentiated, and not convert back into being a stem cell.
# The second way is the addition of methyl groups to the DNA, mostly at [[CpG site]]s, to convert [[cytosine]] to [[5-methylcytosine]].  5-Methylcytosine performs much like a regular cytosine, pairing up with a guanine. However, some areas of the genome are methylated more heavily than others, and highly methylated areas tend to be less transcriptionally active, through a mechanism not fully understood. Methylation of cytosines can also persist from the germ line of one of the parents into the zygote, marking the chromosome as being inherited from this parent ([[genetic imprinting]]).

The way that the cells stay differentiated in the case of DNA methylation is clearer to us than it is in the case of histone shape.  Basically, certain enzymes (such as [[DNA methyltransferase|DNMT1]]) have a higher affinity for the methylated cytosine.  If this enzyme reaches a &quot;hemimethylated&quot; portion of DNA (where methylcytosine is in only one of the two DNA strands) the enzyme will methylate the other half.

Although histone modifications occur throughout the entire sequence, the unstructured N-termini of histones (called histone tails) are particularly highly modified. These modifications include [[acetylation]], [[methylation]], [[ubiquitylation]], [[phosphorylation]] and [[sumoylation]]. Acetylation is the most highly studied of these modifications. For example, acetylation of the K14 and K9 [[lysine]]s of the tail of histone H3 by histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) is generally correlated with transcriptional competence.

One mode of thinking is that this tendency of acetylation to be associated with &quot;active&quot; transcription is biophysical in nature. Because it normally has a positively charged nitrogen at its end, lysine can bind the negatively charged phosphates of the DNA backbone. The acetylation event converts the positively charged amine group on the side chain into a neutral amide linkage. This removes the positive charge, thus loosening the DNA from the histone. When this occurs, complexes like [[SWI/SNF]] and other transcriptional factors can bind to the DNA and allow transcription to occur.  This is the &quot;cis&quot; model of epigenetic function.  In other words, changes to the histone tails have a direct effect on the DNA itself.

Another model of epigenetic function is the &quot;trans&quot; model.  In this model changes to the histone tails act indirectly on the DNA.  For example, lysine acetylation may create a binding site for chromatin modifying enzymes (and basal transcription machinery as well).  This Chromatin Remodeler can then cause changes to the state of the chromatin.  Indeed, the bromodomain &amp;mdash; a protein segment (domain) that specifically binds acetyl-lysine &amp;mdash; is found in many enzymes that help activate transcription, including the [[SWI/SNF]] complex (on the protein polybromo). It may be that acetylation acts in this and the previous way to aid in transcriptional activation.

The idea that modifications act as docking modules for related factors is borne out by histone methylation as well. Methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 has long been associated with constitutively transcriptionally silent chromatin (constitutive [[heterochromatin]]). It has been determined that a chromodomain (a domain that specifically binds methyl-lysine) in the transcriptionally repressive protein [[Heterochromatin Protein 1|HP1]] recruits HP1 to K9 methylated regions. One example that seems to refute this biophysical model for acetylation is that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 is strongly associated with (and required for full) transcriptional activation. Tri-methylation in this case would introduce a fixed positive charge on the tail.

It has been shown that the histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT) is responsible for this methylation activity in the pattern of histones H3 &amp; H4. This enzyme utilizes a catalytically active site called the SET domain (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax). The SET domain is a 130-amino acid sequence involved in modulating gene activities. This domain has been demonstrated to bind to the histone tail and causes the methylation of the histone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jenuwein |first1=T |last2=Laible |first2=G |last3=Dorn |first3=R |last4=Reuter |year=1998 |first4=G |title=SET domain proteins modulate chromatin domains in eu- and heterochromatin |journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences |publisher= |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=80–93 |pmid=9487389 |doi=10.1007/s000180050127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differing histone modifications are likely to function in differing ways; acetylation at one position is likely to function differently than acetylation at another position. Also, multiple modifications may occur at the same time, and these modifications may work together to change the behavior of the nucleosome. The idea that multiple dynamic modifications regulate gene transcription in a systematic and reproducible way is called the [[histone code]].

DNA methylation frequently occurs in repeated sequences, and helps to suppress the expression and mobility of '[[transposable elements]]':&lt;ref name=&quot;slotkin2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[5-methylcytosine]] is chemically very similar to [[thymidine]], CpG sites are frequently mutated and become rare in the genome, except at [[CpG islands]] where they remain unmethylated. Epigenetic changes of this type thus have the potential to direct increased frequencies of permanent genetic mutation. [[DNA methylation]] patterns are known to be established and modified in response to environmental factors by a complex interplay of at least three independent [[DNA methyltransferase]]s, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, the loss of any of which is lethal in mice.&lt;ref name=&quot;li92&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Histones H3 and H4 can also be manipulated through demethylation using histone lysine demethylase (KDM).  This recently identified enzyme has a catalytically active site called the Jumonji domain (JmjC).  The demethylation occurs when JmjC utilizes multiple cofactors to hydroxylate the methyl group, thereby removing it.  JmjC is capable of demethylating mono-, di-, and tri-methylated substrates. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nottke |first1=A |last2=Colaiácovo |first2=MP |last3=Shi |first3=Y |year=2009 |title=Developmental role of the histone lysine demethylases |journal=Development |publisher= |volume=6 |issue=136 |pages=879–89 pmid=19234061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromosomal regions can adopt stable and heritable alternative states resulting in bistable gene expression without changes to the DNA sequence.

Because DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling play such a central role in many types of epigenic inheritance, the word &quot;epigenetics&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for these processes. However, this can be misleading. Chromatin remodeling is not always inherited, and not all epigenetic inheritance involves chromatin remodeling.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Ptashne, 2007. On the use of the word ‘epigenetic’. ''Current Biology'', '''17'''(7):R233–R236. {{doi|10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the [[histone code]] could be mediated by the effect of small RNAs. The recent discovery and characterization of a vast array of small (21- to 26-nt), non-coding RNAs suggests that there is an RNA component, possibly involved in epigenetic gene regulation. [[Small interfering RNA]]s can modulate transcriptional gene expression via epigenetic modulation of targeted [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]]s.&lt;ref name=Morris&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg|author= Morris KV|year=2008|chapter=Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression|title=RNA and the Regulation of Gene Expression: A Hidden Layer of Complexity|publisher=Caister Academic Press|id=[http://www.horizonpress.com/rnareg ISBN 978-1-904455-25-7]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RNA transcripts and their encoded proteins===
Sometimes a gene, after being turned on, transcribes a product that (either directly or indirectly) maintains the activity of that gene. For example, [[Hnf4]] and [[MyoD]] enhance the transcription of many liver- and muscle-specific genes, respectively, including their own, through the [[transcription factor]] activity of the [[proteins]] they encode. RNA signalling includes differential recruitment of a hierarchy of generic chromatin modifying complexes and DNA methyltransferases to specific loci by RNAs during differentiation and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mattick | first1 = JS | last2 = Amaral | first2 = PP | last3 = Dinger | first3 = ME | last4 = Mercer | first4 = TR | last5 = Mehler | first5 = MF | title = RNA regulation of epigenetic processes. | journal = BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19154003 | doi = 10.1002/bies.080099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other epigenetic changes are mediated by the production of different [[Splicing (genetics)|splice forms]] of [[RNA]], or by formation of double-stranded RNA ([[RNAi]]). Descendants of the cell in which the gene was turned on will inherit this activity, even if the original stimulus for gene-activation is no longer present. These genes are most often turned on or off by [[signal transduction]], although in some systems where [[syncytia]] or [[gap junctions]] are important, RNA may spread directly to other cells or nuclei by [[diffusion]]. A large amount of RNA and protein is contributed to the [[zygote]] by the mother during [[oogenesis]] or via [[nurse cell]]s, resulting in [[maternal effect]] phenotypes. A smaller quantity of sperm RNA is transmitted from the father, but there is recent evidence that this epigenetic information can lead to visible changes in several generations of offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;choi06&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Prions===
{{details|Prions}}
[[Prion]]s are infectious forms of [[protein]]s. In general, proteins fold into discrete units that perform distinct cellular functions, but some proteins are also capable of forming an infectious conformational state known as a prion.  Although often viewed in the context of [[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|infectious disease]], prions are more loosely defined by their ability to catalytically convert other native state versions of the same protein to an infectious conformational state.  It is in this latter sense that they can be viewed as epigenetic agents capable of inducing a phenotypic change without a modification of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Epigenetic inheritance and prions| author=A. Yool and W.J. Edmunds| journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology| year=1998| pages=241–242| volume=11 | doi = 10.1007/s000360050085| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fungal prion]]s are considered epigenetic because the infectious phenotype caused by the prion can be inherited without modification of the genome.  [[PSI (prion)|PSI+]] and URE3, discovered in [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]] in 1965 and 1971, are the two best studied of this type of prion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=[PSI], a cytoplasmic suppressor of super-suppression in yeast| author=B.S.

In PSI+ cells, the loss of the Sup35 protein (which is involved in termination of translation) causes ribosomes to have a higher rate of read-through of stop [[codon]]s, an effect that results in suppression of [[nonsense mutation]]s in other genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Extrachromosomal psi+ determinant suppresses nonsense mutations in yeast|author=S.W.

===Structural inheritance systems===
{{details|Structural inheritance}}

In [[ciliate]]s such as ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' and ''[[Paramecium]]'', genetically identical cells show heritable differences in the patterns of ciliary rows on their cell surface. Experimentally altered patterns can be transmitted to daughter cells. It seems existing structures act as templates for new structures. The mechanisms of such inheritance are unclear, but reasons exist to assume that multicellular organisms also use existing cell structures to assemble new ones.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Sapp, Beyond the Gene.  1987 Oxford University Press.

==Functions and consequences==
=== Development===
Somatic epigenetic inheritance, particularly through DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling, is very important in the development of multicellular eukaryotic organisms.  The genome sequence is static (with some notable exceptions), but cells differentiate into many different types, which perform different functions, and respond differently to the environment and intercellular signalling.  Thus, as individuals develop, [[morphogen]]s activate or silence genes in an epigenetically heritable fashion, giving cells a &quot;memory&quot;.  In mammals, most cells terminally differentiate, with only [[stem cells]] retaining the ability to differentiate into several cell types (&quot;totipotency&quot; and &quot;multipotency&quot;).  In [[mammal]]s, some stem cells continue producing new differentiated cells throughout life, but mammals are not able to respond to loss of some tissues, for example, the inability to regenerate limbs, which some other animals are capable of.  Unlike animals, plant cells do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant.  While plants do utilise many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as [[chromatin remodeling]], it has been hypothesised that plant cells do not have &quot;memories&quot;, resetting their gene expression patterns at each cell division using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Costa | first1 = Silvia | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Peter | year = 2006 | title = 'Open Minded' cells: how cells can change fate | url = | journal = Trends in Cell Biology | pmid = 17194589 | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 101–106 | doi = 10.1016/j.tcb.2006.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
Epigenetics has many and varied potential medical applications as it tends to be multidimensional in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.discoverymedicine.com/Richard-Chahwan/2011/03/17/the-multidimensional-nature-of-epigenetic-information-and-its-role-in-disease/ | pmid = 21447282 | volume=11 | issue=58 | year=2011 | month=March | pages=233–43 | author=Chahwan R, Wontakal SN, Roa S | title = The multidimensional nature of epigenetic information and its role in disease | journal = Discovery medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congenital genetic disease is well understood, and it is also clear that epigenetics can play a role, for example, in the case of [[Angelman syndrome]] and [[Prader-Willi syndrome]].  These are normal genetic diseases caused by gene deletions or inactivation of the genes, but are unusually common because individuals are essentially [[hemizygous]] because of [[genomic imprinting]], and therefore a single gene knock out is sufficient to cause the disease, where most cases would require both copies to be knocked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{OMIM|105830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
Although epigenetics in multicellular organisms is generally thought to be a mechanism involved in differentiation, with epigenetic patterns &quot;reset&quot; when organisms reproduce, there have been some observations of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (e.g., the phenomenon of [[paramutation]] observed in [[maize]]). Although most of these multigenerational epigenetic traits are gradually lost over several generations, the possibility remains that multigenerational epigenetics could be another aspect to evolution and adaptation. A sequestered germ line or [[Weismann barrier]] is specific to animals, and epigenetic inheritance is expected to be far more common in plants and microbes. These effects may require enhancements to the standard conceptual framework of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eva |last=Jablonka |authorlink=Eva Jablonka |coauthors=Marion J. Lamb |title=Evolution in Four Dimensions |publisher=MIT Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-262-10107-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Denis Noble]] ''The Music of Life'' see esp pp. 93–8 and p. 48 where he cites Jablonka &amp; Lamb and [[Massimo Pigliucci]]'s review of Jablonka and Lamb in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] '''435''', 565–566 (2 June 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigenetic features may play a role in short-term adaptation of species by allowing for reversible phenotype variability. The modification of epigenetic features associated with a region of DNA allows organisms, on a multigenerational time scale, to switch between phenotypes that express and repress that particular gene.&lt;ref name=rando_and_verstrepen&gt;{{cite journal| author=O.J. Rando and K.J. Verstrepen| title=Timescales of Genetic and Epigenetic Inheritance| journal=Cell| volume=128| pages=655–668| year=2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.023| pmid=17320504| issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the DNA sequence of the region is not mutated, this change is reversible. It has also been speculated that organisms may take advantage of differential mutation rates associated with epigenetic features to control the mutation rates of particular genes.&lt;ref name=rando_and_verstrepen /&gt; Interestingly, recent analysis have suggested that members of the APOBEC/AID family of cytosine deaminases are capable of simultaneously mediating genetic and epigenetic inheritance using similar molecular mechanisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chahwan R, Wontakal SN, and Roa S&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author= Chahwan R., Wontakal S.N., and Roa S.| title=Crosstalk between genetic and epigenetic information through cytosine deamination| journal=Trends in Genetics| volume = 26| pages = 443–448| year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.005| pmid = 20800313| issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Epigenesis.jpg|framed|]] 

Evolutionary epigenetics can be divided into predetermined and probabilistic epigenesis. Predetermined epigenesis is a unidirectional movement from structural development in DNA  to the functional maturation of the protein. Predetermined meaning that development is scripted and predictable. Probabilistic epigenesis on the other hand is a bidirectional structure-function development with experiences and external molding development.&lt;ref&gt;Biology and Philosophy, Vol. 20, No. 2-3. (March 2005), pp. 517-544.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Epigenetic changes have also been observed to occur in response to environmental exposure&amp;mdash;for example, mice given some dietary supplements have epigenetic changes affecting expression of the [[agouti gene]], which affects their fur color, weight, and propensity to develop cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Cooney, CA, Dave, AA, and Wolff, GL| title=Maternal Methyl Supplements in Mice Affect Epigenetic Variation and DNA Methylation of Offspring| year=2002| journal=Journal of Nutrition| volume=132| pages=2393S–2400S| pmid=12163699| issue=8 Suppl}}[http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/132/8/2393S available online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;waterland&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author= Waterland RA and Jirtle RL| title = Transposable elements: Targets for early nutritional effects on epigenetic gene regulation| journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology| year = 2003| month = August| volume = 23| issue = 15| pages = 5293–5300| url = http://mcb.asm.org/cgi/content/full/23/15/5293 | doi = 10.1128/MCB.23.15.5293-5300.2003| pmid = 12861015| pmc= 165709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 100 cases of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance phenomena have been reported in a wide range of organisms, including prokaryotes, plants, and animals.

==Epigenetic effects in humans==
=== Genomic imprinting and related disorders ===
Some human disorders are associated with [[genomic imprinting]], a phenomenon in mammals where the father and mother contribute different epigenetic patterns for specific genomic loci in their [[germ cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Genomic imprinting in mammals: Emerging themes and established theories| author=A.J.

[[Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]] is also associated with genomic imprinting, often caused by abnormalities in maternal genomic imprinting of a region on chromosome 11.

===Transgenerational epigenetic observations===
''See main article [[Transgenerational epigenetics]]''

Marcus Pembrey and colleagues also observed in the [[Överkalix study]] that the paternal (but not maternal) grandsons &lt;ref name=&quot;paternal-grandson&quot;&gt;A paternal grandson is the son of a grandparent's son; a maternal grandson is the son of a grandparent's daughter.&lt;/ref&gt; of Swedish men who were exposed during preadolescence to famine in the 19th century were less likely to die of cardiovascular disease; if food was plentiful then [[diabetes]] mortality in the grandchildren increased, suggesting that this was a transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Pembrey ME, Bygren LO, Kaati G, ''et al.''.

=== Cancer and developmental abnormalities ===
A variety of compounds are considered as epigenetic [[carcinogens]]&amp;mdash;they result in an increased incidence of tumors, but they do not show [[mutagenic|mutagen]] activity (toxic compounds or pathogens that cause tumors incident to increased regeneration should also be excluded). Examples include [[diethylstilbestrol]], [[arsenite]], [[hexachlorobenzene]], and [[nickel]] compounds.

In announcing the funding, government officials noted that epigenetics has the potential to explain mechanisms of aging, human development, and the origins of cancer, heart disease, mental illness, as well as several other conditions. Some investigators, like Randy Jirtle, PhD, of Duke University Medical Center, think epigenetics may ultimately turn out to have a greater role in disease than genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Beil |title= Medicine's New Epicenter?

====DNA methylation in cancer====
[[DNA methylation]] is an important regulator of gene transcription and a large body of evidence has demonstrated that aberrant DNA methylation is associated with unscheduled gene silencing, and the genes with high levels of 5-methylcytosine in their promoter region are transcriptionally silent. DNA methylation is essential during embryonic development, and in somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are in general transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been associated with a large number of human malignancies and found in two distinct forms: hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue. Hypermethylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications that repress transcription via promoter region of tumour suppressor genes. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms.&lt;ref name= CraigJMWongNC&gt;{{cite book | author= Craig, JM; Wong, NC (editor) | year=2011 | title=Epigenetics: A Reference Manual | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-88-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Variant histones H2A in cancer====
The [[histone]] variants of the H2A family are highly conserved in mammals, playing critical roles in regulating many nuclear processes by altering [[chromatin]] structure. One of the key H2A variants, H2A.X, marks DNA damage, facilitating the recruitment of DNA repair proteins to restore genomic integrity. Another variant, H2A.Z, plays an important role in both gene activation and repression. A high level of H2A.Z expression is ubiquitously detected in many cancers and is significantly associated with cellular proliferation and genomic instability.&lt;ref name=&quot;CraigJMWongNC&quot;/&gt;

====Cancer treatment====
Current research has shown that epigenetic pharmaceuticals could be a putative replacement or adjuvant therapy for currently accepted treatment methods such as [[radiation therapy|radiation]] and [[chemotherapy]], or could enhance the effects of these current treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=LG |last2=Chiao |first2=JW |year=2010 |title=Prostate cancer chemopreventive activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate through epigenetic regulation (review) |journal=International Journal of Oncology |publisher= |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=533–9 |pmid=20664922}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that the epigenetic control of the proto-onco regions and the tumor suppressor sequences by conformational changes in histones directly affects the formation and progression of cancer &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iglesias-Linares |first1=A |last2=Yañez-Vico |first2=RM |last3=González-Moles |first3=MA |year=2010 |title=Potential role of HDAC inhibitors in cancer therapy: insights into oral squamous cell carcinoma |journal=Oral Oncology |publisher= |volume=5 |issue=46 |pages=323–9 |pmid=20207580 |doi=10.1016/j.oraloncology.2010.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetics also has the factor of reversibility, a characteristic that other cancer treatments do not offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Drug development has focused mainly on Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT) and Histone Deacetylase (HDAC), including the introduction of the new pharmaceutical [[Vorinostat]], a HDAC inhibitor, to the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spannhoff |first1=A |last2=Sippl |first2=W |last3=Jung |first3=M |year=2009 |title=Cancer treatment of the future: Inhibitors of histone methyltransferases |journal=The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology |publisher= |volume=1 |issue=41 |pages=4–11 |pmid=18773966 |doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2008.07.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; HDAC has been shown to play an integral role in the progression of oral squamous cancer &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

Current front-runner candidates for new drug targets are [[Histone methyltransferase|Histone Lysine Methyltransferases]] (KMT) and Protein Arginine Methyltransferases (PRMT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year= 2010|title=Toward the development of potent and selective bisubstrate inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferases |journal=Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters |publisher= |volume=7 |issue=20 |pages=2103–5 |pmid=20219369 |doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2010.02.069 |month=April |author=Dowden J, Hong W, Parry RV, Pike RA, Ward SG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epigenetics in microorganisms ==
[[Image:Escherichia coli flagella TEM.png|thumb|150px|Escherichia coli bacteria]]
Bacteria make widespread use of postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Bacteria make use of DNA [[adenine]] methylation (rather than DNA [[cytosine]] methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation is important in bacteria virulence in organisms such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella]], [[Vibrio]], [[Yersinia]], [[Haemophilus]]'', and ''[[Brucella]]''. In ''[[Alphaproteobacteria]]'', methylation of adenine regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In ''[[Gammaproteobacteria]]'', adenine methylation provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage, transposase activity and regulation of gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casadesus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author= Casadesus J and Low D| title = Epigenetic Gene Regulation in the Bacterial World| journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev| year = 2006| month = September| volume = 70| issue = 3| pages = 830–856 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00016-06| pmid= 16959970| pmc= 1594586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = JorgTost/&gt;

The filamentous fungus ''Neurospora crassa'' is a prominent model system for understanding the control and function of cytosine methylation. In this organisms, DNA methylation is associated with relics of a genome defense system called RIP (repeat-induced point mutation) and silences gene expression by inhibiting transcription elongation.&lt;ref&gt;Genome Res.  2009.   19:  427-437/doi: 10.1101/gr.086231.108&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[yeast]] [[prion]] PSI is generated by a conformational change of a translation termination factor, which is then inherited by daughter cells. This can provide a survival advantage under adverse conditions. This is an example of epigenetic regulation enabling unicellular organisms to respond rapidly to environmental stress. Prions can be viewed as epigenetic agents capable of inducing a phenotypic change without modification of the genome.&lt;ref name=JorgTost&gt;{{cite book | author = Tost J (editor). | title = Epigenetics | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/epi | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/epi ISBN 978-1-904455-23-3 ] | isbn = 1904455239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1080">'''Epigenetics''' has two closely related meanings:
* The study of the processes involved in the unfolding development of an organism. This includes phenomena such as [[X chromosome]] inactivation in mammalian females, and [[gene silencing]] within an organism.
* The study of ''heritable'' changes in [[gene]] function that occur without a change in the sequence of [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[DNA]].  This includes the study of how environmental factors affecting a parent can result in changes in the way genes are expressed in the offspring.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27081">Epigenetic inheritance is the transmittance of information from one generation to the next that affects the traits of offspring without alteration of the [[Primary_structure#Primary_structure|primary structure]] of [[DNA]] (i.e., the sequence of nucleotides) or from environmental cues.  The term “epigenetic inheritance” is used to describe both cell–cell and organism–organism information transfer, while '''transgenerational epigenetics''' typically refers only to the latter.  Although these two levels of epigenetic inheritance are equivalent in unicellular organisms, they may have distinct mechanisms and evolutionary distinctions in multicellular organisms.
[[File:Cloned mice with different DNA methylation.png|thumb|300px|Cloned mice with different DNA methylation patterns causing kinks in the tail of one but not the other.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, J (2003) Human epigenome project—Up and running. PLoS Biol 1(3): e82. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0000082&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Four general categories of epigenetic modification are known:&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka E and MJ Lamb (2010). Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In: M Pigliucci and GB Müller Evolution, the expanded synthesis&lt;/ref&gt; 1) self-sustaining metabolic loops, in which a [[mRNA]] or [[protein]] product of a gene stimulates [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the gene (e.g. ''Wor1'' gene in ''Candida albicans''&lt;ref&gt;Zordan, RE, DJ Galgoczy, and AD Johnson (2006) Epigenetic properties of white-opaque switching in ''Candida albicans'' are based on self-sustaining transcriptional feedback loop. PNAS 103: 12807-12812&lt;/ref&gt;), 2) structural templating in which structures are replicated using a template or scaffold structure on the parent (e.g. [[prions]], proteins that replicate by changing the structure of normal proteins to match their own), 3) [[chromatin]] marks, in which methyl or acetyl groups bind to DNA [[nucleotides]] or [[histones]] thereby altering gene expression patterns (e.g. ''Lcyc'' gene in ''Linaria vulgaris'' described below), and 4) RNA silencing, in which small RNA strands interfere (RNAi) with the transcription of DNA or translation of mRNA (known only from a few studies, mostly in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''&lt;ref&gt;Vastenhouw, NL, K Brunschwig, KL Okihara, F Muller, M Tijseterman, and RHA Plasterk (2006) Long-term gene silencing by RNAi. Nature 422: 882&lt;/ref&gt;).

For some epigenetically influenced traits, the epigenetic marks can be induced by the environment and some marks are heritable, leading some to view epigenetics as a relaxation of the rejection of [[soft inheritance]] of acquired characteristics.

== Major Controversies in the History of the Inheritance ==
Humans have recognized that traits of the parents are often seen in offspring.  This insight led to the practical application of selective breeding of plants and animals, eventually leading to domestication, but did not address the central question of inheritance: how are these traits conserved between generations, and what causes variation?

=== Blending vs. Particulate Inheritance ===
Addressing these related questions, scientists during the time of the Enlightenment largely argued for the blending hypothesis, in which parental traits were homogenized in the offspring much like buckets of different colored paint being mixed together.&lt;ref&gt;Vorzimmer, P (1963) Charles Darwin and blending inheritance. Isis 54(3): 371–390&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of Charles Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'', pointed out that under this scheme of inheritance, variation would quickly be swamped by the majority phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkin, F (1867) Review of ''The Origin of Species''. North British Review http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/jenkins.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In the paint bucket analogy, this would be seen by mixing two colors together and then mixing the resulting color with only one of the parent colors 20 times; the rare variant color would quickly fade.

Unknown to most of the European scientific community, a monk by the name of [[Gregor Mendel]] had resolved the question of how traits are conserved between generations through breeding experiments with pea plants.&lt;ref&gt;Mendel, G (1866) Versuche über Plflanzenhybriden. Verhandlungen des naturforschenden Vereines in Brünn, Bd. IV für das Jahr 1865, Abhandlungen, 3–47.  English translation available at: http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/gm-65-a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles Darwin]] thus did not know of Mendel's proposed &quot;particulate inheritance&quot; in which traits were not blended but passed to offspring in discrete units that we now call genes.  Darwin came to reject the blending hypothesis even though his ideas and Mendel's were not unified until the 1930s, a period referred to as the [[Modern Synthesis]].

=== Inheritance of Innate vs. Acquired Characteristics ===
In his 1809 book, ''Philosophie Zoologique'',&lt;ref&gt;Lamarck, JBPA (1809) Philosophie zoologique: ou Exposition des considérations relative à l'histoire naturelle des animaux. Dentu et L'Auteur, Paris [http://books.google.com/books?id=8NsTAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Philosophie+zoologique:+ou+Exposition+des+consid%C3%A9rations+relative&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SchFTZriBZTmsQPMjYWJCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] recognized that each species experiences a unique set of challenges due to its form and environment.  Thus, he proposed that the characters used most often would accumulate a “nervous fluid.”  Such acquired accumulations would then be transmitted to the individual’s offspring.  In  modern terms, a nervous fluid transmitted to offspring would be a form of epigenetic inheritance.

Lamarckism, as this body of thought became known, was the standard explanation for change in species over time when Charles Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] co-proposed a theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859.  Responding to Darwin and Wallace's theory, a revised neo-Lamarckism attracted a small following of biologists,&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, PJ (1989) Evolution: the history of an idea. University of California Press, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; though the Lamarckian zeal was quenched in large part due to [[August Weismann|Weismann’s]]&lt;ref&gt;Weismann, A (1891) Essays upon heredity and kindred biological problems. Transl. EB Poulton, S Schönland, E Shipley Clarendon Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; famous experiment in which he cut off the tails of mice over several successive generations without having any effect on tail length.  Thus the emergent consensus that acquired characteristics could not be inherited became canon.

=== Origin of epigenetics and revision of the modern synthesis ===
Non-genetic variation and inheritance, however, proved to be quite common.  Concurrent to the Modern Synthesis (unifying Mendelian genetics and natural selection), [[C. H. Waddington]] was working to unify [[developmental biology]] and genetics.  In so doing, he coined the word “epigenetic” to represent the ordered differentiation of embryonic cells into functionally distinct cell types despite having identical primary structure of their DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington CH (1939) Introduction to Modern Genetics. Allen and Unwin, London&lt;/ref&gt;  Waddington’s epigenetics was sporadically discussed, becoming more of a catch-all for puzzling non-genetic heritable characters rather than advancing the body of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Holliday, R (2006) Epigenetics: a historical overview. Epigenetics 1: 76–80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nanney, DL (1958) Epigenetic control mechanisms. PNAS 44: 712–717&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the definition of Waddington’s word has itself evolved, broadening beyond the subset of developmentally signaled, inherited cell specialization.

Does epigenetic inheritance compromise the foundation of the Modern Synthesis?  Outlining the [[Central Dogma of Molecular Biology]], [[Francis Crick]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/F/T/_/scbbft.pdf Crick, FHC (1958) On protein synthesis. Symp Soc Exp Biol XII, 139–163]&lt;/ref&gt; succinctly stated, “DNA is held in a configuration by histone[s] so that it can act as a passive template for the simultaneous synthesis of RNA and protein[s].  ''None'' of the detailed “information” is in the histone (italic added for emphasis).  However, he closes the article stating, “this scheme ''explains the majority'' of the present experimental results!” (italic added for emphasis).  Indeed the emergence of epigenetic inheritance (in addition to advances in the study of evolutionary-development, phenotypic plasticity, evolvability, and systems biology) has strained the current framework of the Modern Synthesis and prompted the re-examination of previously dismissed evolutionary mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Pigliucci, M (2007) Do we need an extended evolutionary synthesis? Evolution 61: 2743–2749&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and inheritance of epigenes ==
''See main article: [[Epigenetics]]''

Epigenetic variation may take one of four general forms.  Others may yet be elucidated, but currently self-sustaining feedback loops, spatial templating, chromatin marking, and RNA-mediated pathways modify epigenes at the level of individual cells.  Epigenetic variation within multicellular organisms may be endogenous, generated by cell–cell signaling (e.g. during cell differentiation early in development), or exogenous, a cellular response to environmental cues.

=== Removal vs. retention of epigenetic marks ===
In sexually reproducing organisms, much of the epigenetic modification within cells is reset during meiosis (e.g. marks at the FLC locus controlling plant vernalization &lt;ref&gt;Bond, DM and EJ Finnegan (2007) Passing the message on: inheritance of epigenetic traits. Trends Plant Sci 12: 211–216&lt;/ref&gt;), though some epigenetic responses have been shown to be conserved (e.g. transposon methylation in plants &lt;ref&gt;Bond, DM and EJ Finnegan (2007) Passing the message on: inheritance of epigenetic traits. Trends Plant Sci 12: 211–216&lt;/ref&gt;).  Differential inheritance of epigenetic marks due to underlying maternal or paternal biases in removal or retention mechanisms may lead to the assignment of epigenetic causation to some parent of origin effects in animals&lt;ref&gt;Morison, IM and AE Reeve (1998) A catalogue of imprinted genes and parent-of-origin effects in humans and animals. Human Molecular Genetics 7: 1599–1609 doi: 10.1093/hmg/7.10.1599&lt;/ref&gt; and plants.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, RJ, M Spielman, J Bailey, and HG Dickinson (1998) Parent-of-origin effects on seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Development 125: 3329–3341&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Removal of epigenetic marks ====
In mammals, male and female gametes join during fertilization in different cell cycle states and with different configuration of the genome.  The epigenetic marks of the male are rapidly diluted.  First, the protamines associated with male DNA are replaced with histones from the female's [[cytoplasm]], most of which are acetylated due to either higher abundance of acetylated histones in the female's cytoplasm or through preferential binding of the male DNA to acetylated histones.&lt;ref&gt;Adenot, PG, Y Mercier, JP Renard, and EM Thompson (1997) Differential H4 acetylation of paternal and maternal chromatin precedes DNA replication and differential transcriptional activity in pronuclei of 1-cell mouse embryos. Development 124: 4625–4625&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santos, F, B Hendrich, W Reik, and W Dean (2002) Dynamic reprogramming of DNA methylation in the early mouse embryo. Developmental Biology 241: 172–182&lt;/ref&gt;  Second, male DNA is systematically demethylated in many organisms,&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, J, S Engemann, N Lane, W Mayer, A Olek, R Fundele, W Dean, W Reik, and J Walter (2000) Active demethylation of the paternal genome in the mouse zygote. Current Biology 10: 475–478&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fulka, H, M Mrazek, O Tepla, and J Fulka (2004) DNA methylation pattern in human zygotes and developing embryos. Reproduction 128: 703–708&lt;/ref&gt; however the mechanism and functional outcome of this process has yet to be elucidated.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, HD, F Santos, K Green, W Dean, and W Reik (2005) Epigenetic reprogramming in mammals. Human Molecular Genetics 14: R47-R58 doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddi114&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of the importance of epigenetic programming to the establishment and fixation of cell line identity during early embryogenesis has recently stimulated interest in artificial removal of epigenetic programming.&lt;ref&gt;Surani, MA and P Hajkova (2010) Epigenetic reprogramming of mouse germ cells toward totipotency. Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology doi: 10.1101/sqb.2010.75.010&lt;/ref&gt;  Epigenetic manipulations may allow for restoration of totipotency in [[stem cells]] or cells more generally, thus generalizing [[regenerative medicine]].

==== Retention of epigenetic marks ====
Cellular mechanisms may allow for co-transmission of some epigenetic marks.  During replication, DNA polymerases working on the leading and lagging strands are coupled by the DNA processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which has also been implicated in patterning and strand crosstalk that allows for copy fidelity of epigenetic marks.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Z, K Shibahara, and B Stillman (2000) PCNA connects DNA replication to epigenetic inheritance in yeast. Nature 408: 221–225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, DS, SS Banga, TA Grigliatti, and JB Boyd (1994) Mutagen sensitivity and suppression of position-effect variegation result from mutations in ''mus209'', the ''Drosophila'' gene encoding PCNA. EMBO Journal 13: 1450–1459&lt;/ref&gt;  Work on histone modification copy fidelity has remained in the model phase, but early efforts suggest that modifications of new histones are patterned on those of the old histones and that new and old histones randomly assort between the two daughter DNA strands.&lt;ref&gt;Probst, AV, E Dunleavy, and G Almouzni (2009) Epigenetic inheritance during the cell cycle. Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology 10: 192–206&lt;/ref&gt;  With respect to transfer to the next generation, many marks are removed as described above.  Emerging studies are finding patterns of epigenetic conservation across generations.  For instance, [[centromere|centromeric]] satellites resist demethylation.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, HD, F Santos, K Green, W Dean, and W Reik (2005) Epigenetic reprogramming in mammals. Human Molecular Genetics 14: R47-R58 doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddi114&lt;/ref&gt;  The mechanism responsible for this conservation is not known, though some evidence suggests that methylation of histones may contribute.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, F, AH Peters, AP Otte, W Reik, and D Dean. (2005) Dynamic chromatin modifications characterise the first cell cycle in mouse embryos. Developmental Biology 280: 225–236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, HD, F Santos, K Green, W Dean, and W Reik (2005) Epigenetic reprogramming in mammals. Human Molecular Genetics 14: R47-R58 doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddi114&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decay of epigenetic marks ===
Whereas the [[mutation rate]] in a given 100 base gene may be 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; per generation, epigenes may “mutate” several times per generation or may be fixed for many generations.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, EJ (2006) Inherited epigenetic variation – revisiting soft inheritance. Natur Rev Gen 7: 395–401&lt;/ref&gt;  This raises the question: are changes in epigene frequencies is evolution?  Rapidly decaying epigenetic effects on phenotypes (i.e. lasting less than three generations) may explain some of the residual variation in phenotypes after genotype and environment are accounted for.  However, distinguishing these short-term effects from the effects of the maternal environment on early [[ontogeny]] remains a challenge.

== Contribution to phenotypes ==
The relative importance of genetic and epigenetic inheritance is subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka, E and MJ Lamb (1998) Epigenetic inheritance in evolution. J Evol Biol 11: 159–183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Replies to Jablonka and Lamb 1998 in J. Evol. Biol. 11(2)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though hundreds of examples of epigenetic modification of phenotypes have been published,&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka, E and G Raz (2009) Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: Prevalence, mechanisms, and implications for study of heredity and evolution. Quart Rev Biol 84: 131–176&lt;/ref&gt; few studies have been conducted outside of the laboratory setting.&lt;ref&gt;Bossdorf, O, CL Richards, and M Pigliucci (2008) Epigenetics for ecologists. Ecology Letters 11: 106–115&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the interactions of genes and epigenes with the environment cannot be inferred despite the central role of environment in natural selection.  Experimental methodologies for manipulating epigenetic mechanisms are nascent (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Molinier, J, G Ries, C Zipfel, and B Hohn (2006) Transgeneration memory of stress in plants. Nature 442: 1046–1049 doi:10.1038/nature05022&lt;/ref&gt;) and will need rigorous demonstration before studies explicitly testing the relative contributions of genotype, environment, and epigenotype are feasible.

A study has shown chilhood abuse (defined in this study as “sexual contact, severe physical abuse and/or severe neglect”) leads to epigenetic modifications of glucocorticoid receptor expression&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weaver | first1 = IC | last2 = Cervoni | first2 = N | last3 = Champagne | first3 = FA | last4 = D'alessio | first4 = AC | last5 = Sharma | first5 = S | last6 = Seckl | first6 = JR | last7 = Dymov | first7 = S | last8 = Szyf | first8 = M | last9 = Meaney | first9 = MJ | title = Epigenetic programming by maternal behavior | journal = Nature neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 847–54 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15220929 | doi = 10.1038/nn1276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGowan | first1 = PO | last2 = Sasaki | first2 = A | last3 = D'alessio | first3 = AC | last4 = Dymov | first4 = S | last5 = Labonté | first5 = B | last6 = Szyf | first6 = M | last7 = Turecki | first7 = G | last8 = Meaney | first8 = MJ | title = Epigenetic regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor in human brain associates with childhood abuse | journal = Nature neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 342–8 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19234457 | pmc = 2944040 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which play a role in HPA activity. Animal experiments have shown that epigenetic changes depend on mother-infant interactions after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meaney | first1 = MJ | last2 = Szyf | first2 = M | title = Environmental programming of stress responses through DNA methylation: life at the interface between a dynamic environment and a fixed genome | journal = Dialogues in clinical neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–23 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16262207 | pmc=3181727}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent study investigating correlations among maternal stress in pregnancy and methylation in teenagers and their mothers, it has been found that children of women who were abused during pregnancy were significantly more likely than others to have methylated glucocorticoid-receptor genes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Radtke | first1 = KM | last2 = Ruf | first2 = M | last3 = Gunter | first3 = HM | last4 = Dohrmann | first4 = K | last5 = Schauer | first5 = M | last6 = Meyer | first6 = A | last7 = Elbert | first7 = T | title = Transgenerational impact of intimate partner violence on methylation in the promoter of the glucocorticoid receptor | journal = Translational psychiatry | volume = 1| issue = July 19 | pages = | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2011.21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn change the response to stress, leading to a higher susceptibility to anxiety.

== Effects on Fitness ==
Epigenetic inheritance may only affect [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] if it predictably alters a trait under selection.  Evidence has been forwarded that environmental stimuli are important agents in the alteration of epigenes.  Ironically, Darwinian evolution may act on these neo-Lamarckian acquired characteristics as well as the cellular mechanisms producing them (e.g. methyltransferase genes).
Epigenetic inheritance may confer a fitness benefit to organisms that deal with environmental changes at intermediate timescales.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka, E and MJ Lamb (1995) Epigenetic inheritance and evolution: the Lamarckian dimension. Oxford University Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;  Short-cycling changes are likely to have DNA-encoded regulatory processes, as the probability of the offspring needing to respond to changes multiple times during their lifespans is high.  On the other end, natural selection will act on populations experiencing changes on longer-cycling environmental changes.  In these cases, if epigenetic priming of the next generation is deleterious to fitness over most of the interval (e.g. misinformation about the environment), these genotypes and epigenotypes will be lost.  For intermediate time cycles, the probability of the offspring encountering a similar environment is sufficiently high without substantial selective pressure on individuals lacking a genetic architecture capable of responding to the environment.  Naturally, the absolute lengths of short, intermediate, and long environmental cycles will depend on the trait, the length of epigenetic memory, and the generation time of the organism.
Much of the interpretation of epigenetic fitness effects centers on the hypothesis that epigenes are important contributors to phenotypes, which remains to be resolved.

=== Deleterious effects ===
[[File:Linaria forms.jpg|thumb|300px|''Linaria vulgaris'' ([[Scrophulariaceae]]) with different levels of methylation of the gene ''Lcyc''. The radially symmetric mutant (left) is heavily methylated such that the ''Lcyc'' is not transcribed while the wild type (right) has bilateral symmetry. From &lt;ref&gt;Grant-Downton, RT and HG Dickinson (2006) Epigenetics and its implications for plant biology 2. The ‘epigenetic epiphany’: Epigenetics, evolution and beyond. Annals of Botany 97: 11–27. doi: 10.1093/aob/mcj001&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Inherited epigenetic marks may be important for regulating important components of fitness.  In plants, for instance, the ''Lcyc'' gene in ''[[Linaria vulgaris]]'' controls the symmetry of the flower.  [[Linnaeus]] first described radially symmetric mutants, which arises when ''Lcyc'' is heavily methylated.&lt;ref&gt;Cubas, P, C Vincent, and E Coen (1999) An epigenetic mutation responsible for natural variation in floral symmetry. Nature: 401-157-161&lt;/ref&gt;  Given the importance of floral shape to pollinators,&lt;ref&gt;Dafni A, Kevan PG. 1997 Flower size and shape: implications in pollination. Israeli Journal of Plant Science 45:201–211&lt;/ref&gt; methylation of ''Lcyc'' homologues (e.g. ''CYCLOIDEA'') may have deleterious effects on plant fitness.  In animals, numerous studies have shown that inherited epigenetic marks can increase susceptibility to disease.  Transgenerational epigenetic influences are also suggested to contribute to disease, especially cancer, in humans.  Tumor methylation patterns in gene promotors have been shown to correlate positively with familial history of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Frazier ML, L Xi, J Zong, et al. (2003) Association of the CpG island methylator phenotype with family history of cancer in patients with colorectal cancer. Cancer Research 63:4805–4808&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, methylation of the ''MSH2'' gene is correlated with early-onset colorectal and endometrial cancers.&lt;ref&gt;Chan TL, ST Yuen, CK Kong, et al. (2006) Heritable germline epimutation of ''MSH2'' in a family with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Nature Reviews Genetics 38: 1178–1183&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Putatively adaptive effects ===
Experimentally demethylated seeds of the [[model organism]] ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' have significantly higher mortality, stunted growth, delayed flowering, and lower fruit set,&lt;ref&gt;Bossdorf, O, D Arcuri, CL Richards, and M Pigliucci (2010) Experimental alteration of DNA methylation affects the phenotypic plasticity of ecologically relevant traits in ''Arabidopsis thaliana''. Evolutionary Ecology 24:541–553&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that epigenes may increase fitness.  Furthermore, environmentally induced epigenetic responses to stress have been shown to be inherited and positively correlated with fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Whittle, CA, SP Otto, MO Johnston, and JE Krochko (2009) Adaptive epigenetic memory of ancestral temperature regime in ''Arabidopsis thaliana''. Botany 87: 650–657&lt;/ref&gt;  In animals, communal nesting changes mouse behavior increasing parental care regimes&lt;ref&gt;Curley, JP, FA Champagne, and P Bateson (2007) Communal nesting induces alternative emotional, social and maternal behavior in offspring. Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology 11th Annual Meeting Pacific Grove, CA, USA.  Cited in Branchi, I (2009) The mouse communal nest: Investigating the epigenetic influences of the early social environment on brain and behavior development. Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews 33: 551–559&lt;/ref&gt; and social abilities&lt;ref&gt;Branchi, I, I D’Andrea, M Fiore, V Di Fausto, L Aloe, and E Alleva (2006) Early social enrichment shapes social behavior and nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in the adult mouse brain. Biological Psychiatry 60: 690–696&lt;/ref&gt; that are hypothesized to increase offspring survival and access to resources (such as food and mates), respectively.

== Macroevolutionary Patterns ==
Inherited epigenetic effects on phenotypes have been documented in bacteria, protists, fungi, plants, and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka, E and G Raz (2009) Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: Prevalence, mechanisms, and implications for study of heredity and evolution. Quart Rev Biol 84: 131–176&lt;/ref&gt;  Though no systematic study of epigenetic inheritance has been conducted (most focus on model organisms), there is preliminary evidence that this mode of inheritance is more important in plants than in animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka, E and G Raz (2009) Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: Prevalence, mechanisms, and implications for study of heredity and evolution. Quart Rev Biol 84: 131–176&lt;/ref&gt; The early differentiation of animal [[germlines]] is likely to preclude epigenetic marking occurring later in development, while in plants and fungi [[somatic]] cells may be incorporated into the germ line.&lt;ref&gt;Whitham, TG and CN Slobodchikoff (1981) Evolution by individuals, plant-herbivore interactions, and mosaics of genetic variability: The adaptive significance of somatic mutations in plants. Oecologia 49: 287–292 DOI: 10.1007/BF00347587&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turian, G (1979) Sporogenesis in fungi. Annual Review of Phytopathology 12: 129–137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Life history]] patterns may also contribute to the occurrence of epigenetic inheritance.  Sessile organisms, those with low dispersal capability, and those with simple behavior may benefit most from conveying information to their offspring via epigenetic pathways.  Geographic patterns may also emerge, where highly variable and highly conserved environments might host fewer species with important epigenetic inheritance.

uses [[bioinformatic]] methods{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} to complement experimental research in [[epigenetics]]. Due to the recent explosion of epigenome datasets, computational methods play an increasing role in all areas of epigenetic research.

==Definition==
Research in computational epigenetics comprises the development and application of bioinformatic methods for solving epigenetic questions, as well as computational data analysis and theoretical modeling in the context of epigenetics. 

==Current research areas==
===Epigenetic data processing and analysis===
Various experimental techniques have been developed for genome-wide mapping of epigenetic information, the most widely used being [[ChIP-on-chip]], [[ChIP-seq]] and [[bisulfite sequencing]]. All of these methods generate large amounts of data and require efficient ways of data processing and quality control by bioinformatic methods. 

===Epigenome prediction===
A substantial amount of bioinformatic research has been devoted to the [[prediction]] of epigenetic information from characteristics of the [[genome sequence]]. Such predictions serve a dual purpose. First, accurate epigenome predictions can substitute for experimental data, to some degree, which is particularly relevant for newly discovered epigenetic mechanisms and for species other than human and mouse. Second, prediction algorithms build statistical models of epigenetic information from training data and can therefore act as a first step toward quantitative modeling of an epigenetic mechanism.

===Applications in cancer epigenetics===
The important role of epigenetic defects for [[cancer]] opens up new opportunities for improved diagnosis and therapy. These active areas of research give rise to two questions that are particularly amenable to bioinformatic analysis. First, given a list of genomic regions exhibiting epigenetic differences between tumor cells and controls (or between different disease subtypes), can we detect common patterns or find evidence of a functional relationship of these regions to cancer? Second, can we use bioinformatic methods in order to improve diagnosis and therapy by detecting and classifying important disease subtypes?

==Emerging topics==
The first wave of research in the field of computational epigenetics was driven by rapid progress of experimental methods for data generation, which required adequate computational methods for data processing and quality control, prompted epigenome prediction studies as a means of understanding the genomic distribution of epigenetic information, and provided the foundation for initial projects on cancer epigenetics. While these topics will continue to be major areas of research and the mere quantity of epigenetic data arising from epigenome projects poses a significant bioinformatic challenge, several additional topics are currently emerging.
* Epigenetic regulatory circuitry: Reverse engineering the regulatory networks that read, write and execute epigenetic codes.
* [[Population epigenetics]]: Distilling regulatory mechanisms from the integration of epigenome data with [[gene expression]] profiles and [[haplotype]] maps for a large sample from a heterogeneous population.''
* [[Evolutionary epigenetics]]: Learning about epigenome regulation in human (and its medical consequences) by cross-species comparisons.
* Theoretical modeling: Testing our mechanistic and quantitative understanding of epigenetic mechanisms by [[in silico]] simulation.
* [[Genome browsers]]: Developing a new blend of web services that enable biologists to perform sophisticated genome and epigenome analysis within an easy-to-use genome browser environment.
* [[Medical epigenetics]]: Searching for epigenetic mechanisms that play a role in diseases other than cancer, as there is strong circumstantial evidence for epigenetic regulation being involved in [[mental disorders]], [[autoimmune diseases]] and other complex diseases.

An '''Epigenome''' consists of a record of the chemical changes to the [[DNA]] and [[histone]] proteins of an organism; these changes can be passed down to an organism's offspring. Changes to the epigenome can result in changes to the structure of [[chromatin]] and changes to the function of the [[genome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernstein (2007)&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=Bradley E.|coauthors=Meissner,  Alexander; Lander,Eric S.|title=The Mammalian Epigenome|journal=[[Cell (journal){{!}}Cell]]|year=2007|month=February|volume=128|issue=4|pages=669–681|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.033|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867407001286|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Epigenetics is one of the current topics in [[cancer]] research drawing active research. Human [[tumor|tumors]] undergo a major disruption of [[DNA]] [[methylation]] and [[histone]] modification patterns. The aberrant epigenetic landscape of the cancer cell is characterized by a large genomic [[hypomethylation]], [[CpG]] island promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor [[genes]], an altered [[histone]] code for critical genes and a global loss of monoacetylated and trimethylated histone H4.

Much of the subject matter is not yet fully understood. Some people have suggested a Human Epigenome Project.&lt;ref name=Jones(2005)&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Peter A.|coauthors=Martienssen, Robert|title=A Blueprint for a Human Epigenome Project: The AACR Human Epigenome Workshop|journal=[[Cancer Research (journal){{!}}Cancer Research]]|date=December 15, 2005|volume=65|issue=24|pages=11241|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3865|url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/65/24/11241.short|accessdate=19 December 2011|pmid=16357125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Human Epigenome Consortium is a public/private collaboration that aims to identify and catalogue Methylation Variable Positions (MVPs) in the human genome. As a prelude to the full-scale Human Epigenome Project (HEP), scientists have recently completed a pilot study of the methylation patterns within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) - a region of chromosome 6 that is associated with more diseases than any other region in the human genome.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
They claim to have identified MVPs in the vicinity of the promoter and other relevant regions of approximately 150 loci within the MHC in tissues from a range of individuals. This will provide an unprecedented insight into the complex relationship between genetics and epigenetics that underlies both normal cellular homeostasis and disease states, in particular autoimmune diseases. &lt;ref&gt;Human Epigenome Project&lt;/ref&gt;

For the pilot project, we developed an integrated genomics-based technology platform. The pipeline involves the automated bisulphite treatment of DNA from minute tissue biopsies, gene-specific bisulphite PCR and large-scale sequencing of PCR amplicons. Analysis and quantification of methylation patterns is achieved by mass spectrometric and microarray assays.

One thing that still puzzles scientists is whether or not we can change our phenotype, characteristics that reflect our genes(genotype), but not our genotype.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3699">The '''Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics''' (MPI) in Freiburg, Germany, is an interdisciplinary research institute that conducts basic research in modern immunobiology and developmental biology. 
It was founded in 1961 as Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and is one of 80 institutions of the [[Max Planck Society]]. 

The researchers of the MPI study the development of the immune system and analyse the genes and molecules which are important for its function. They also seek to establish which factors control the maturation of immune cells and how chemical changes of the DNA influence the immune defense.

In 2007, the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology added [[Epigenetics]] as a new research area. In 2010, the institute changed its name to Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics.
The 1984 Nobel Prize-winning biologist [[Georges J. F. Köhler]] was a director of the institute from 1984 until his death in 1995.

==Organisation==
The Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics is organised into four departments:
* Cellular and Molecular Immunology (Head: Prof. Dr. Rudolf Grosschedl)
* Developmental Immunology (Head: Prof. Dr. Thomas Boehm)
* Epigenetics (Head: Prof. Dr. Thomas Jenuwein)
* Molecular Embryology (Head: Prof. Dr. Rolf Kemler)

In addition to the four departments, the institute includes 
* a Max Planck Investigator Group on Chromatin Regulation (Head: Dr. Asifa Akhtar)
* an adjunct University Department on Molecular Immunology (Head: Prof. Dr. Michael Reth)
* the Spemann Laboratory, which has the aim of promoting the early independence of junior scientists.

==Management==
The Management Board of the MPI comprises elected scientific members of the Max Planck Society. These serve a dual function as co-directors of the institute and as department heads. The managing directorship rotates every three years among these co-directors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16772">In the chemical sciences, '''methylation''' denotes the addition of a [[methyl|methyl group]] to a [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] or the substitution of an atom or group by a methyl group. Methylation is a form of [[alkylation]] with, to be specific, a methyl group, rather than a larger carbon chain, replacing a [[Hydrogen#Compounds|hydrogen]] atom. These terms are commonly used in chemistry, [[biochemistry]], soil science, and the biological sciences.

In biological systems, methylation is [[Catalysis|catalyzed]] by [[enzyme]]s; such methylation can be involved in modification of [[heavy metals]], regulation of [[gene expression]], regulation of [[Protein#Functions|protein function]], and [[RNA metabolism]]. Methylation of [[heavy metals]] can also occur outside of [[biological systems]]. Chemical methylation of tissue samples is also one method for reducing certain [[Histology#Histological Artifacts|histological staining artifacts]].

==In biology==
===Epigenetics===
Methylation contributing to [[epigenetic inheritance]] can occur through either DNA methylation or protein methylation.

'''[[DNA methylation]]''' in vertebrates typically occurs at [[CpG site]]s (cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites, that is, where a [[cytosine]] is directly followed by a [[guanine]] in the DNA sequence).  This methylation results in the conversion of the cytosine to [[5-methylcytosine]]. The formation of Me-CpG is [[Catalysis|catalyzed]] by the enzyme [[DNA methyltransferase]].  Human DNA has about 80%-90% of CpG sites methylated, but there are certain areas, known as CpG islands, that are GC-rich (made up of about 65% CG residues), wherein none are methylated. These are associated with the promoters of 56% of mammalian genes, including all ubiquitously expressed genes. One to two percent of the human genome are CpG clusters, and there is an inverse relationship between CpG methylation and transcriptional activity.

'''Protein methylation''' typically takes place on [[arginine]] or [[lysine]] [[amino acid]] residues in the protein sequence.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-9747077-3-2. &quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Christopher Walsh |title=Posttranslational modification of proteins: expanding nature's inventory |publisher=Roberts and Co. Publishers |location= |year=2006 |pages= |chapter=Chapter 5 - Protein Methylation |isbn=0-9747077-3-2. |oclc= |chapterurl=http://www.roberts-publishers.com/walsh/chapter5.pdf |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arginine can be methylated once (monomethylated arginine) or twice, with either both methyl groups on one terminal nitrogen (asymmetric dimethylated arginine) or one on both nitrogens (symmetric dimethylated arginine) by [[peptidylarginine methyltransferases]] (PRMTs). Lysine can be methylated once, twice or three times by [[lysine methyltransferases]]. Protein methylation has been most-studied in the [[histone]]s. The transfer of [[methyl]] groups from [[S-adenosyl methionine]] to histones is catalyzed by enzymes known as [[histone methyltransferase]]s. Histones that are methylated on certain residues can act [[Epigenetics|epigenetically]] to repress or activate gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15145346&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grewal SI, Rice JC |title=Regulation of heterochromatin by histone methylation and small RNAs |journal=Curr.

===Embryonic development===
{{main|Reprogramming}}
During the development of germ cells their genomes are [[demethylation|demethylated]], while chromosomes in the [[somatic cell]]s retain the parental methylation patterns. After that, a ''De novo'' methylation of the germ cells occurs, modifying and adding epigenetic information to the genome based on the sex of the individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Carroll, Sean B.; Wessler, Susan R.; Griffiths, Anthony J. F.; Lewontin, Richard C. |title=Introduction to genetic analysis |publisher=W.H. Freeman and CO |location=New York |year=2008 |page=403 |isbn=0-7167-6887-9 |edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After fertilization of an [[oocyte]] and formations of a [[zygote]], its combined genome is demethylated and remethylated again (with the exception of the [[imprinted gene]]s). By [[blastula]] stage, the methylation of the embryonic cells is complete.

The process of demethylation/remethylation is referred to as &quot;[[reprogramming]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mann MR, Bartolomei MS |title=Epigenetic reprogramming in the mammalian embryo: struggle of the clones |journal=Genome Biol. |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=1003.1–.4 |year=2002 |pmid=11864375 |pmc=139014 |url=http://genomebiology.com/1465-6906/3/REVIEWS1003 |doi=10.1186/gb-2002-3-2-reviews1003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of methylation was shown in [[gene knockout|knockout]] mutants without DNA methyltransferase, which all died at the [[morula]] stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/s00467-010-1714-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postnatal development===
Increasing evidence is revealing a role of methylation in the interaction of environmental factors with genetic expression. Differences in maternal care during the first 6 days of life in the [[rat]] induce differential methylation patterns in some [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] regions, thus influencing [[gene expression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17965624&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weaver IC |title=Epigenetic programming by maternal behavior and pharmacological intervention. Nature versus nurture: let's call the whole thing off |journal=Epigenetics |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=22–8 |year=2007 |pmid=17965624 |doi= 10.4161/epi.2.1.3881|url=http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/epi/abstract.php?id=3881}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, even-more-dynamic processes such as [[interleukin]] signaling have been shown to be regulated by methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12605226&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bird A |title=Il2 transcription unleashed by active DNA demethylation |journal=Nat.

Research in humans has shown that repeated high level activation of the body’s stress system, especially in early childhood, can alter methylation processes and lead to changes in the chemistry of the individual’s DNA.  The chemical changes can disable genes and prevent the brain from properly regulating its response to stress.  Researchers and clinicians  have drawn a link between this neurochemical disregulation and the development of chronic health problems such as depression, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21420958 | year = 2011 | last1 = Caldji | first1 = C | last2 = Hellstrom | first2 = IC | last3 = Zhang | first3 = TY | last4 = Diorio | first4 = J | last5 = Meaney | first5 = MJ | title = Environmental regulation of the neural epigenome | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2011.03.032 | journal = FEBS letters }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16260130 | year = 2005 | last1 = Champagne | first1 = FA | last2 = Curley | first2 = JP | title = How social experiences influence the brain | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 704–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2005.10.001 | journal = Current opinion in neurobiology }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16513834 | year = 2006 | last1 = Champagne | first1 = FA | last2 = Weaver | first2 = IC | last3 = Diorio | first3 = J | last4 = Dymov | first4 = S | last5 = Szyf | first5 = M | last6 = Meaney | first6 = MJ | title = Maternal care associated with methylation of the estrogen receptor-alpha1b promoter and estrogen receptor-alpha expression in the medial preoptic area of female offspring | volume = 147 | issue = 6 | pages = 2909–15 | doi = 10.1210/en.2005-1119 | journal = Endocrinology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9635069 | year = 1998 | last1 = Felitti | first1 = VJ | last2 = Anda | first2 = RF | last3 = Nordenberg | first3 = D | last4 = Williamson | first4 = DF | last5 = Spitz | first5 = AM | last6 = Edwards | first6 = V | last7 = Koss | first7 = MP | last8 = Marks | first8 = JS | title = Relationship of childhood abuse and household dysfunction to many of the leading causes of death in adults.

===Cancer===
The pattern of methylation has recently become an important topic for research. Studies have found that in normal tissue, methylation of a gene is mainly localized to the [[coding region]], which is CpG-poor. In contrast, the promoter region of the gene is unmethylated, despite a high density of CpG islands in the region.

[[Neoplasia]] is characterized by &quot;methylation imbalance&quot; where [[genome]]-wide [[wiktionary:hypomethylation|hypomethylation]] is accompanied by localized [[wiktionary:hypermethylation|hypermethylation]] and an increase in [[gene expression|expression]] of [[DNA methyltransferase]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9338076&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baylin SB, Herman JG, Graff JR, Vertino PM, Issa JP |title=Alterations in DNA methylation: a fundamental aspect of neoplasia |journal=Adv. Cancer Res. |volume=72 |issue= |pages=141–96 |year=1998 |pmid=9338076 |doi=10.1016/S0065-230X(08)60702-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall methylation state in a cell might also be a precipitating factor in carcinogenesis as evidence suggests that genome-wide hypomethylation can lead to chromosome instability and increased mutation rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9738504&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chen RZ, Pettersson U, Beard C, Jackson-Grusby L, Jaenisch R |title=DNA hypomethylation leads to elevated mutation rates |journal=Nature |volume=395 |issue=6697 |pages=89–93 |year=1998 |pmid=9738504 |doi=10.1038/25779}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methylation state of some genes can be used as a [[wiktionary:biomarker|biomarker]] for [[wiktionary:tumorigenesis|tumorigenesis]]. For instance, hypermethylation of the [[GSTP1|pi-class glutathione S-transferase gene (GSTP1)]] appears to be a promising [[diagnostic indicator]] of [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14755684&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nakayama M, Gonzalgo ML, Yegnasubramanian S, Lin X, De Marzo AM, Nelson WG |title=GSTP1 CpG island hypermethylation as a molecular biomarker for prostate cancer |journal=J. Cell. Biochem. |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=540–52 |year=2004 |pmid=14755684 |doi=10.1002/jcb.10740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cancer, the dynamics of genetic and epigenetic gene silencing are very different. Somatic genetic mutation leads to a block in the production of functional protein from the mutant allele. If a selective advantage is conferred to the cell, the cells expand clonally to give rise to a tumor in which all cells lack the capacity to produce protein. In contrast, epigenetically mediated gene silencing occurs gradually. It begins with a subtle decrease in transcription, fostering a decrease in protection of the CpG island from the spread of flanking heterochromatin and methylation into the island. This loss results in gradual increases of individual CpG sites, which vary between copies of the same gene in different cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12042769&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones PA, Baylin SB |title=The fundamental role of epigenetic events in cancer |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=415–28 |year=2002 |pmid=12042769 |doi=10.1038/nrg816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacterial host defense===
In addition, [[adenosine]] or [[cytosine]] methylation is part of the [[restriction modification system]] of many [[bacteria]]. Bacterial [[DNA]]s are methylated periodically throughout the genome.  A [[methylase]] is the enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence and methylates one of the bases in or near that sequence.  Foreign DNAs (which are not methylated in this manner) that are introduced into the [[cell (biology)|cell]] are degraded by sequence-specific [[restriction enzyme]]s. Bacterial genomic DNA is not recognized by these restriction enzymes.  The methylation of native DNA acts as a sort of primitive immune system, allowing the bacteria to protect themselves from infection by [[bacteriophage]].  These restriction enzymes are the basis of [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP) testing, used to detect DNA [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]].

==In chemistry==
The term methylation in [[organic chemistry]] refers to the [[alkylation]] process used to describe the delivery of a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-471-58589-0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=March, Jerry; Smith, Michael W. |title=March's advanced organic chemistry: reactions, mechanisms, and structure |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0-471-58589-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is commonly performed using [[electrophile|''electrophilic'']] methyl sources - [[iodomethane]], [[dimethyl sulfate]], [[dimethyl carbonate]], or less commonly with the more powerful (and more dangerous) methylating reagents of [[methyl triflate]] or methyl fluorosulfonate ([[magic methyl]]), which all react via  S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 [[nucleophilic substitution]]. For example a [[carboxylate]] may be methylated on oxygen to give a methyl [[ester]], an [[alkoxide]] salt RO&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; may be likewise methylated to give an [[ether]], ROCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, or a ketone [[enolate]] may be methylated on carbon to produce a new [[ketone]].

:[[Image:Iodomethane rxn1.png|350px|Methylation of a [[carboxylic acid]] salt and a [[phenol]] using [[iodomethane]]]]

On the other hand, the methylation may involve use of [[nucleophile|''nucleophilic'']] methyl compounds such as [[methyllithium]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li) or [[Grignard reagent]]s (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;MgX). For example, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li will methylate [[acetone]], adding across the [[carbonyl]] ([[C=O]]) to give the lithium [[alkoxide]] of [[tert-Butanol|''tert''-butanol]]:

Waddington, known as &quot;Wad&quot; to his friends and &quot;Con&quot; to family, was born to Hal and Mary Ellen (Warner) Waddington, 8 November 1905. Until nearly three years of age, Waddington lived with his parents in India, where his father worked on a tea estate in the [[Wayanad district]]. In 1910, at the age of four, he was sent to live with family in England including his aunt, uncle, and Quaker grandmother. His parents remained in India until 1928. During his childhood, he was particularly attached to a local druggist and distant relation, Dr. Doeg. Doeg, who Waddington called &quot;Grandpa&quot;, introduced Waddington to a wide range of sciences from chemistry to geology.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Alan. 1977. &quot;Conrad Hal Waddington. 8 November 1905&amp;ndash;26 September 1975.&quot; ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''23''', 575-622. Pp. 575-76.&lt;/ref&gt; During the year following the completion of his entrance exams to university, Waddington received an intense course in chemistry from E. J. Holmyard. Aside from being &quot;something of a genius of a [chemistry] teacher,&quot; Holmyard introduced Waddington to the &quot;Alexandrian Gnostics&quot; and the &quot;Arabic Alchemists.&quot; From these lessons in metaphysics, Waddington first gained an appreciation for interconnected holistic systems. Waddington reflected that this early education prepared him for [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s philosophy in the 1920s and 30s and the [[cybernetics]] of [[Norbert Wiener]] and others in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, C. H. 1975. ''The Evolution of an Evolutionist''. Ithica, NY: Cornell University Press. Pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Clifton College]] and [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]]. He took the Natural Sciences [[Tripos]], earning a First in Part II in geology in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Alan. 1977. &quot;Conrad Hal Waddington. 8 November 1905 &amp;mdash; 26 September 1975.&quot; ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''23''', 575-622. Pg 577.&lt;/ref&gt; He took up a Lecturership in Zoology and was a Fellow of [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] until 1942. His friends included [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Walter Gropius]], [[C. P. Snow]], [[Solly Zuckerman]], [[Joseph Needham]], and [[John Desmond Bernal|J. D. Bernal]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Alan. 1977. &quot;Conrad Hal Waddington. 8 November 1905 &amp;mdash; 26 September 1975.&quot; ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''23''', 575-622. Pp. 579-580.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yoxen, Edward. 1986. &quot;Form and Strategy in Biology: Reflections on the Career of C. H. Waddington.&quot; In ''A History of Embryology'', edited by T. J Horder, J. A Witkowski, and C. C Wylie. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Pp. 310-11.&lt;/ref&gt; His interests began with [[palaeontology]] but moved on to the [[heredity]] and development of living things. He also studied philosophy.

During [[World War II]] he was involved in [[operational research]] with the [[Royal Air Force]] and became scientific advisor to the Commander in Chief of [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]] from 1944 to 1945.  After the war he became Professor of Animal Genetics at the [[University of Edinburgh]].  He would stay at Edinburgh for the rest of life with the exception of one year (1960–1961) when he was a Fellow on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at [[Wesleyan University]] in Middletown, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html |title=Guide to the Center for Advanced Studies Records, 1958 - 1969 |publisher=Wesleyan.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His personal papers are largely kept at the University of Edinburgh library.

Waddington was married twice. His first marriage produced a son, C. Jake Waddington, professor of physics at the [[University of Minnesota]], but ended in 1936. He then married Justin Blanco White, daughter of the writer [[Amber Reeves]], with whom he had two daughters, mathematician [[Dusa McDuff]] and anthropologist [[Caroline Humphrey]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Alan. 1977. Conrad Hal Waddington. 8 November 1905 &amp;mdash; 26 September 1975. ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''23''', 575-622. P. 578&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, Waddington and many other embryologists looked for the molecules that would induce the amphibian neural tube. The search was, of course, beyond the technology of that time, and most embryologists moved away from such deep problems. Waddington, however, came to the view that the answers to embryology lay in genetics, and in 1935 went to [[Thomas Hunt Morgan|Thomas Hunt Morgan's]] ''Drosophila'' laboratory in California, even though this was a time when most embryologists felt that genes were unimportant and just played a role in minor phenomena such as eye colour.

In the late 30's, Waddington produced formal models about how gene regulatory products could generate developmental phenomena, showed how the mechanisms underpinning Drosophila development could be studied through a systematic analysis of mutations that affected the development of the Drosophila wing (this was the essence of the approach that won the 1995 Nobel prize in medicine for [[Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard]] and [[Eric F. Wieschaus]]). In a period of great creativity at the end of the 1930s, he also discovered mutations that affected cell phenotypes and wrote his first textbook of developmental [[epigenetics]], a term that then meant the external manifestation of genetic activity.

Waddington also coined other essential concepts, such as [[canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]], which refers to the ability of an organism to produce the same phenotype despite variation in genotype or environment. He also identified a mechanism called genetic assimilation which would allow an animal’s response to an environmental stress to become a fixed part of its developmental repertoire, and then went on to show that the mechanism would work. He thus demonstrated that the ideas of inheritance put forward by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] could, in principle at least, occur.

In 1972, Waddington founded the Centre for Human Ecology.

==Epigenetic landscape==
Waddington's [[epigenetic landscape]] is a metaphor for how [[regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]] modulates development.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, A. D., Allis, C. D., &amp; Bernstein, E. (2007). Epigenetics: A landscape takes shape. Cell, 128, 635-638.&lt;/ref&gt; One is asked to imagine a number of marbles rolling down a hill towards a wall. The marbles will compete for the grooves on the slope, and come to rest at the lowest points. These points represent the eventual [[biological cell|cell]] fates, that is, [[biological tissue|tissue]] types. Waddington coined the term [[Chreode]] to represent this cellular developmental process. This idea was actually based on experiment: Waddington found that one effect of mutation (which could modulate the epigenetic landscape) was to affect how cells differentiated. He also showed how mutation could affect the landscape and used this metaphor in his discussions on evolution&amp;mdash;he was the first person to emphasise that evolution mainly occurred through mutations that affected developmental anatomy.

==Waddington as an organiser==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Waddington was very active in advancing biology as a discipline. He contributed to a book on the role of the sciences in times of war, and helped set up several professional bodies representing biology as a discipline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/fref.fcgi?PrId=3058&amp;itool=Abstract-def&amp;uid=14760651&amp;nlmid=101168228&amp;db=pubmed&amp;url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jez.b.20002] Hall BK. 2004. In search of evolutionary developmental mechanisms: the 30-year gap between 1944 and 1974. J Exp Zool B Mol Dev Evol. 2004 Jan 15;302(1):5-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A remarkable number of his contemporary colleagues in Edinburgh became Fellows of the Royal Society during his time there, or shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Alan. 1977. Conrad Hal Waddington. 8 November 1905 &amp;mdash; 26 September 1975. ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''23''', 575-622. P. 585.&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddington was an old-fashioned intellectual who lived in both the arts and science milieus of the 1950s and wrote widely. His 1960 book &quot;Behind Appearance; a Study Of The Relations Between Painting And The Natural Sciences In This Century&quot; (MIT press) not only has wonderful pictures but is still worth reading.

Waddington was, without doubt, the most original and important thinker about developmental biology of the pre-molecular age and the medal of the British Society for Developmental Biology is named after him.

== Nova Science Now, episode on Epigenetics ==

This article is very technical.  It was clearly written for a biologist.  I'm really interested in the subject, so I came to wikipedia to find out more information, but the article is too difficult for me to read.  It would be nice if the article were more accessible to the general public.  One thing that would help is adding more links to the article, so readers can find news articles and other non-technical sources.

One such link that I would like to see in the article is the television episode on Epigenetics by Nova Science Now:
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/3411/02.html

It's a very interesting episode that describes Epigenetics in a way that is exciting and understandable by the general public.  Please consider adding this link to the article.

I removed the first sentence in the Etymology section. I don't know who Dr Foster is, but his name doesn't belong at the beginning of the first sentence of a major section of the article, and his opinion doesn't belong at the top of this article. The new first sentence now cites Waddington, which is appropriate, given his position in the history of this subject.

==Possible merge of Epigenetics-related topics==
Recently, a [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Epigenome|deletion discussion]] was started for  [[Epigenome]]. During the discussion, the merging or redirecting of that article either into either this article or [[Epigenomics]] was suggested. The closing admin opted to close the AfD as keep, because &quot;the possibilities for merging are too diverse to be properly decided here by a simple merge close&quot;. I am bringing this here because this article has a history of recent contributions, so it is likely to be seen here by interested editors. I'd like to have an informal discussion on how people think we should move forward first. I will inform anyone who commented on the AfD. First, I will make a statement of what I think is the probem:

*[[Epigenome]] is short, and not so sweet, the only useful content is a definition, however there is source material available on the topic.
*Any expansion of that article (which I have volunteered to do, should that be the result of this discussion) may overlap too much with [[Epigenomics]]. 
*[[Epigenomics]] itself overlaps significantly with this article.
*Is there a need for three articles in this topic area?

Anyone have any comments on this? &lt;font face=&quot;Franklin Gothic&quot;&gt;[[User:Quasihuman|&lt;font  color=&quot;#99FF66&quot;&gt;Quasi&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Quasihuman|&lt;font color=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;&gt;human&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Quasihuman|&lt;font color=&quot;CCCCCC&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 21:02, 5 January 2012 (UTC)

* 3 articles - did you mean [[Epigenetics]]?

* Well, what to do? If you were starting from scratch, you'd begin with Epigenetics, wouldn't you? And then what would you do if you had a completely free choice? Just make 2 redirects, or what? What needs covering, really? [[User:Chiswick Chap|Chiswick Chap]] ([[User talk:Chiswick Chap|talk]]) 23:58, 5 January 2012 (UTC)
::Yes, I meant [[Epigenome]], [[Epigenomics]] and [[Epigenetics]]. If we were starting from scratch, we would start with [[Epigenetics]], as you said. Personally, if Epigenetics was getting a bit big, I'd make Epigenome next, and then if the study of epigenomes, epigenomics, was a significant topic in its own right, as it is with [[Genomics]], I would then make that. I think that epigenomics is a sub-dicipline to epigenetics, as [[genomics]] is to genetics. I'm not entirely sure that Epigenomics is notable enough to stand as separate article, none of the references cited cover it. If it was my choice, I'd merge [[Epigenomics]] into this article or {{Epigenome]], however, the Epigenomics article is quite substantial, Epigenome is not. &lt;font face=&quot;Franklin Gothic&quot;&gt;[[User:Quasihuman|&lt;font  color=&quot;#99FF66&quot;&gt;Quasi&lt;/font&gt;]][[Special:Contributions/Quasihuman|&lt;font color=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;&gt;human&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;[[User talk:Quasihuman|&lt;font color=&quot;CCCCCC&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/font&gt; 15:22, 6 January 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32962">'''Nutriepigenomics''' is the study of food [[nutrient]]s and their effects on human health through [[epigenetic]] modifications.  There is now considerable evidence that nutritional imbalances during [[gestation]] and [[lactation]] are linked to non-communicable diseases, such as [[obesity]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], and [[cancer]].  If metabolic disturbances occur during critical time windows of development, the resulting epigenetic alterations can lead to permanent changes in tissue and organ structure or function and predispose individuals to disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallou&quot;&gt;Gallou-Kabani C, Vige A, Gross MS, Junien C.

= Overview =
[[Epigenetics]] relates to heritable changes in gene function that occur independently of alterations in primary [[DNA]] sequence.  Two major epigenetic mechanisms implicated in nutriepigenomics are [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone]] modification.  DNA methylation in [[gene promoter]] regions usually results in gene silencing and influences gene expression.  While this form of gene silencing is extremely important in development and cellular differentiation, aberrant DNA methylation can be detrimental and has been linked to various disease processes, such as cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Berdasco M, Esteller M. Aberrant epigenetic landscape in cancer: How cellular identity goes awry. Dev Cell. 2010 Nov 16;19(5):698-711 PMID 21074720.&lt;/ref&gt;  The methyl groups used in DNA methylation are often derived from dietary sources, such as folate and [[choline]], and explains why diet can have a significant impact on methylation patterns and gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pozharny&quot;&gt;Pozharny Y, Lambertini L, Clunie G, Ferrara L, Lee MJ. Epigenetics in women's health care. Mt Sinai J Med. 2010 Mar;77(2):225-35 PMID 20309920.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gene silencing can also be reinforced through the recruitment of [[histone deacetylases]] to decrease transcriptional activation.  Conversely, [[histone acetylation]] induces transcriptional activation to increase gene expression.  Dietary components can influence these epigenetic events, thereby altering gene expression and disturbing functions such as appetite control, metabolic balance and fuel utilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallou&quot;&gt;Gallou-Kabani C, Vige A, Gross MS, Junien C.

Various genetic sequences can be targeted for epigenetic modification.  A transcriptome-wide analysis in mice found that a protein-restricted (PR) diet during gestation resulted in differential gene expression in approximately 1% of the fetal genes analyzed (235/22,690).  Specifically, increased expression was seen in genes involved in the [[p53]] pathway, [[apoptosis]], negative regulators of cell metabolism, and genes related to epigenetic control.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe CP, Goyal R, Holweger JD, Longo LD. Placental gene expression responses to maternal protein restriction in the mouse. Placenta. 2009 May;30(5):411-7 PMID 19362366&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional studies have investigated the effect of a PR-diet in rats and found changes in promoter methylation of both the glucocorticoid receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR).&lt;ref&gt;Lillycrop KA, Phillips ES, Torrens C, Hanson MA, Jackson AA, Burdge GC.

Annu Rev Nutr. 2010 Aug 21;30:315-39 PMID 20415585&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes in expression were reportedly due to epigenetic regulation of either the gene promoter itself, or promoters of transcription factors that regulate gene expression.  Additional genes that have been shown, either by [[in vitro]] or [[in vivo]] studies, to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms include leptin, SOCS3, glucose transporter (GLUT)-4, POMC, 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 and corticotrophin releasing hormone.  Epigenetic modification of these genes may lead to “metabolic programming” of the fetus and result in long-term changes in [[metabolism]] and energy homeostasis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tamashiro&quot;&gt;Tamashiro KL, Moran TH.

==Nutriepigenomics and Development==
The period of development in which the nutritional imbalance occurs is very important in determining which disease-related genes will be affected.  Different organs have critical developmental stages, and the time point at which they are compromised will predispose individuals to specific diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;hanley&quot;&gt;Hanley B, Dijane J, Fewtrell M, Grynberg A, Hummel S, Junien C, Koletzko B, Lewis S, Renz H, Symonds M, Gros M, Harthoorn L, Mace K, Samuels F, van Der Beek EM. Metabolic imprinting, programming and epigenetics - a review of present priorities and future opportunities. Br J Nutr. 2010 Jul;104 Suppl 1:S1-25 PMID 20929595&lt;/ref&gt;  Epigenetic modifications that occur during development may not be expressed until later in life depending on the function of the gene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pozharny&quot;&gt;Pozharny Y, Lambertini L, Clunie G, Ferrara L, Lee MJ. Epigenetics in women's health care. Mt Sinai J Med. 2010 Mar;77(2):225-35.&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority of studies implicate [[prenatal]] and [[perinatal]] periods as critical time windows, some research has shown that nutritional intake during [[adulthood]] can also affect the epigenome.

===Prenatal ===
[[Developmental plasticity]] is a term used to describe the process in which fetuses adapt to their environment.  Environmental cues, including dietary components, present in the [[in utero]] environment can induce significant changes in the expression of the genome through epigenetic modifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burdge&quot;&gt;Burdge GC, Lillycrop KA. Nutrition, epigenetics, and developmental plasticity: Implications for understanding human disease. Annu Rev Nutr. 2010 Aug 21;30:315-39&lt;/ref&gt; Fetal developmental plastic responses can cause changes in lean body mass, endocrinology, blood flow and vascular loading, and lead to increased risk of various diseases in adulthood.

====Low Birth Weight ====
Fetal exposure to calcium, folate, magnesium, high or low protein, and zinc have all been associated with birth weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;hanley&quot;/&gt; Numerous studies have investigated the link between birth weight and risk of disease and have found that low birth weight is significantly associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and type-2 diabetes.  Most importantly, these associations occurred after adjusting for lifestyle factors, implying a genetic basis for onset of disease.&lt;ref name = &quot;Simmons&quot;&gt;Simmons R. Epigenetics and maternal nutrition: Nature v. nurture. Proc Nutr Soc. 2010 Nov 29:1-9 PMID 21110912&lt;/ref&gt;  Impaired [[insulin]] secretion is associated with low birth weight and can lead to insulin resistance as babies accumulate body fat.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen CB, Storgaard H, Dela F, Holst JJ, Madsbad S, Vaag AA. Early differential defects of insulin secretion and action in 19-year-old caucasian men who had low birth weight. Diabetes. 2002 Apr;51(4):1271-80 PMID 11916955&lt;/ref&gt; Studies using intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR) rats have found that growth inhibition can lead to decreased expression of Pdx1 transcription factor, which is essential for differentiation and function of pancreatic beta cells.&lt;ref&gt;Park JH, Stoffers DA, Nicholls RD, Simmons RA. Development of type 2 diabetes following intrauterine growth retardation in rats is associated with progressive epigenetic silencing of Pdx1. J Clin Invest. 2008 Jun;118(6):2316-24 PMID 18464933&lt;/ref&gt;  Decreased histone acetylation at the proximal promoter of Pdx1 is responsible for reduced Pdx1 expression and subsequently results in a cascade of histone deacetylation and methylation events that can result in type-2 diabetes.
[[Image:Histones.jpg|thumb|alt=PDX1 is an essential transcription factor for proper development and function of pancreatic [[beta cells]].  Poor maternal nutrition is linked to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight, and can result in decreased expression of PDX1 through decreased histone acetylation at the PDX1 proximal promoter.  Reduced expression of PDX1 may result in improper formation of beta cells and increase the risk of type-2 diabetes in the offspring.|Development of type 2 diabetes following intrauterine growth retardation in rats is associated with progressive epigenetic silencing of Pdx1]]

==== Obesity ====
Obesity during pregnancy and high-fat maternal diets both show strong associations with obesity in offspring.  As the number of overweight reproductive-age women increases, the number of overweight children and infants also increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simmons&quot;/&gt;  It has been postulated that maternal obesity causes an accumulation of fat in fetal [[adipose tissue]] (adiposity) and predisposes babies for obesity in childhood and adulthood.&lt;ref name = &quot;Simmons&quot;&gt;Simmons R. Epigenetics and maternal nutrition: Nature v. nurture. Proc Nutr Soc. 2010 Nov 29:1-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal studies have shown that maternal overnutrition may impact brain development and cause disruptions to programming of the [[hypothalamus]].  Offspring that were exposed to a high-fat or high-caloric maternal diet had increased levels of insulin, glucose and leptin.  It is hypothesized that these elevations are due to disturbances in the complex neuronal network that includes the neuropeptide Y (NPY) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) pathways.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tamashiro&quot;/&gt;  This altered neuronal signaling can consequently impact food-intake behavior and lead to diet-induced obesity in adulthood.  While epigenetic modifications are most likely involved in the development of obesity, the specific target genes have yet to be identified.  Genes involved in adipogenesis, such as fibroblast growth-factor-2, phosphatase and tensin homologue, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A and oestrogen receptor-alpha, possess multiple [[CpG islands]] in their promoter sites and may act as epigenetic targets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campion&quot;&gt;Campion J, Milagro FI, Martinez JA. Individuality and epigenetics in obesity. Obes Rev. 2009 Jul;10(4):383-92 PMID 19413700&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, it has been shown that prenatal exposure to a hypomethylating agent, such as [[bisphenol A]] (BPA), is associated with increased body weight and suggests modified DNA methylation as a mechanism for increasing susceptibility to obesity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campion&quot;/&gt;

==== Folate ====
It has long been realized that maternal folate intake during pregnancy is linked to fetal development and growth, and can reduce the risk of serious birth defects.  Folate is a source of [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM), which is used to supply DNA methyltransferases with methyl groups.  Therefore, changes in folate supply have a substantial effect on DNA methylation patterns.  Low levels of folate are associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery, poor growth of the placenta and uterus, and intrauterine growth retardation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pozharny&quot;/&gt;  Several complex diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases and [[autism]] have also been linked to maternal folate status.  Based on animal studies it has been hypothesized that reduced folate intake could increase the risk of [[neural tube defects]] by reducing the amount of methylayed DNA during cranial neural tube closure.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlevy LP, Burren KA, Mills K, Chitty LS, Copp AJ, Greene ND. Integrity of the methylation cycle is essential for mammalian neural tube closure. Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol. 2006 Jul;76(7):544-52 PMID 16933307&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently it was discovered that folate protection from congenital heart defects is linked to epigenetics and Wnt signaling.  Multiple environmental factors target the [[Wnt signaling pathway]] during embryogenesis and can cause misregulation of the pathway.  [[Folic acid]] metabolism generates SAM, thereby altering the methylation states of histones H3K9, H3K4, and H3K27 and genetically altering Wnt signaling.&lt;ref&gt;Linask KK, Huhta J. Folate protection from congenital heart defects linked with canonical wnt signaling and epigenetics. Curr Opin Pediatr. 2010 Oct;22(5):561-6 PMID 20844350 .&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perinatal ===
Another critical developmental time window is the perinatal period, which refers to the time period immediately before and after birth.   It has been shown that maternal diet in late pregnancy and an infant’s diet in the beginning weeks can all have significant impacts on gene expression. Therefore, perinatal nutrition refers to both late-stage in utero nutrition and lactation.

==== Bone Health ====
Bone mass and the development of [[osteoporosis]] have been studied in relation to perinatal nutrition.  An important factor to consider when investigating perinatal nutrition is whether the baby was [[breastfeeding|breast-fed]] or formula-fed.  Studies have shown that breast-fed babies have increased bone mass compared to those were not breast-fed, and that this small increase in bone mass during a period of critical development could potentially program the skeleton to continue along a “healthy” growth trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;Jones G, Dwyer T. Birth weight, birth length, and bone density in prepubertal children: Evidence for an association that may be mediated by genetic factors. Calcif Tissue Int. 2000 Oct;67(4):304-8 PMID 11000344&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been shown that maternal [[vitamin D]] insufficiency during late pregnancy is associated with reduced bone size and mineral mass in late childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Javaid MK, Crozier SR, Harvey NC, Gale CR, Dennison EM, Boucher BJ, Arden NK, Godfrey KM, Cooper C, Princess Anne Hospital Study Group. Maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy and childhood bone mass at age 9 years: A longitudinal study. Lancet. 2006 Jan 7;367(9504):36-43 PMID 16399151&lt;/ref&gt;  Peak bone mass has shown to be a good predictor of risk of fracture and osteoporosis, with even a small increase in peak bone mass resulting in a much lower risk of bone fracture.&lt;ref name=&quot;hanley&quot;&gt;Hanley B, Dijane J, Fewtrell M, Grynberg A, Hummel S, Junien C, Koletzko B, Lewis S, Renz H, Symonds M, Gros M, Harthoorn L, Mace K, Samuels F, van Der Beek EM. Metabolic imprinting, programming and epigenetics - a review of present priorities and future opportunities. Br J Nutr. 2010 Jul;104 Suppl 1:S1-25&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that genetic markers explain only a small proportion of variation in bone mass and risk of fracture.  Therefore, healthy bone programming is most likely influenced by various epigenetic mechanisms, such as imprinting of the growth promoting genes IGF-2, or changes to the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA).&lt;ref&gt;Cooper C, Harvey N, Cole Z, Hanson M, Dennison E. Developmental origins of osteoporosis: The role of maternal nutrition. Adv Exp Med Biol. 2009;646:31-9 PMID 19536660&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neurodevelopment ====
Imbalances in maternal nutrition can also have a significant effect on fetal [[neurodevelopment]].  Brain development occurs most rapidly during fetal development and infancy, and research has shown that exposure to certain environmental conditions can have long lasting effects on [[cognition]].  Specifically, n-3 fatty acids, iodine, iron and choline have been shown to influence brain development and impact cognitive ability and behavior.  The greatest evidence for a link between nutrition and neurodevelopment comes from studies that show low birth weight associated with low IQ and increased risk of [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards M, Hardy R, Kuh D, Wadsworth ME. Birth weight and cognitive function in the british 1946 birth cohort: Longitudinal population based study. BMJ. 2001 Jan 27;322(7280):199-203 PMID 11159613&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gunnell D, Harrison G, Whitley E, Lewis G, Tynelius P, Rasmussen F. The association of fetal and childhood growth with risk of schizophrenia. cohort study of 720,000 swedish men and women. Schizophr Res. 2005 Nov 15;79(2-3):315-22 PMID 16125903.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies suggest that breast-feeding promotes long-term neurodevelopment by providing the nutrients necessary for proper brain development.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas A. Programming by early nutrition: An experimental approach. J Nutr. 1998 Feb;128(2 Suppl):401S-6S PMID 9478036&lt;/ref&gt;  A study in mice showed that choline-deficient diets during the late gestation period impaired fetal brain development, including decreased cell proliferation and reduced visual-spatial and auditory memory.&lt;ref&gt;Mehedint MG, Niculescu MD, Craciunescu CN, Zeisel SH. Choline deficiency alters global histone methylation and epigenetic marking at the Re1 site of the calbindin 1 gene. FASEB J. 2010 Jan;24(1):184-95 PMID 19752176&lt;/ref&gt;  These cognitive changes appeared to be due to altered histone and DNA methylation patterns in the fetal [[hippocampus]], thus providing a link between maternal nutrition, epigenetics, and early brain development.

==== Type-1 Diabetes ====
It has been postulated that breast-feeding may also protect against type-1 diabetes, with research showing that formula-fed infants are at an increased risk of developing islet [[autoantibodies]].  Individuals with type-1 diabetes experience a pre-clinical diabetes phase characterized by [[autoimmunity]] against [[pancreatic islets]].&lt;ref&gt;Eisenbarth GS. Type I diabetes mellitus. A chronic autoimmune disease. N Engl J Med. 1986 May 22;314(21):1360-8 PMID 3517648&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of certain foods in the first few months of life, such as berries and cereal, is significantly associated with increased risk of islet autoantibody development compared to babies who are exposed to solid foods later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler AG, Schmid S, Huber D, Hummel M, Bonifacio E. Early infant feeding and risk of developing type 1 diabetes-associated autoantibodies. JAMA. 2003 Oct 1;290(13):1721-8 PMID 14519706&lt;/ref&gt;  While the pathogenesis behind development of autoantibodies remains largely unknown, it is very probable that an epigenetic link exists between perinatal diet and risk of type-1 diabetes.&lt;ref name=&quot;hanley&quot;/&gt;

=== Adulthood ===
The majority of research in nutriepigenomics has focused on nutritional imbalances during gestation and lactation periods.  However, foods that are consumed during adulthood can also impact gene expression and disease pathogenesis.  Cancer is the disease most commonly associated with adult nutrition and epigenetic modifications. DNA hypomethelation promotes cancer progression by allowing increased gene transcription, while hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor genes and further promote uncontrolled [[cell division]] and [[tumor]] formation.  Compounds found in foods, such as [[genistein]] and [[tea polyphenols]], are able to regulate DNA methyltransferases and histone acetylation in cultured cancer cells and may provide protection against certain types of cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campion&quot;/&gt;  Other dietary compounds, such as [[diallyl disulfide]] present in garlic and [[sulforaphane]] present in cruciferous vegetables, have been associated with cancer prevention in clinical trials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;&gt;Davis CD, Ross SA. Dietary components impact histone modifications and cancer risk. Nutr Rev. 2007 Feb;65(2):88-94 PMID 17345961&lt;/ref&gt;  This is due to their ability to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes and prevent silencing of important regulatory genes.

== Transgenerational effects ==
'''See main article [[Transgenerational epigenetics]]'''

Many believe epigenetic regulation is cleared during the [[fertilization]] process, yet more evidence for transgenerational effects (TGEs) are being revealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallou&quot;/&gt; These TGEs take place when the epigenetic regulatory patterns are not sufficiently erased during fertilization, possibly due to nutrition levels in previous generations. Later generations may be affected from caloric and protein restriction, high-fat interventions and endocrine disruption in earlier generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallou&quot;/&gt;  Differences within the nutritional behavior of the maternal rat are believed to cause malprogramming in the F1 generation and may then be passed to subsequent generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallou&quot;/&gt;   
Maternal rats fed a PR-diet during the entire length of pregnancy led to metabolic-related problems in the F1 and F2 generations, even with normal nutrition during the F1 pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Martin JF, Johnston CR, Han CT, Benyshek DC. Nutritional origins of insulin resistance: a rat model for diabetes-prone human populations. 2000. J Nutr. 130:741-44 PMID 10736323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zambrano E, Martinez-Samayoa PM, Bautista CJ, Deas M, Guillen L, Rodriguez-Gonzalez GL, Guzman C, Larrea F &amp; Nathanielsz PW.

J Physiol (Lond.) 566:225-36 PMID 15860532&lt;/ref&gt; These effects have also been seen in the F3 generation depending on the length of protein restriction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison&quot;&gt;Harrison M &amp; Langley-Evans SC. Intergenerational programming of impaired nephrogenesis and hypertension in rats following maternal protein restriction during pregnancy. 2009. Br. J. Nutr. 101: 1020-30 PMID 18778527&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benyshek&quot;&gt;Benyshek DC, Johnston CS &amp; Martin JF. Glucose metabolism is altered in the adequately-nourished grand-offspring (F3 generation) of rats malnourished during gestation and perinatal life. 2006. Diabetologia. 49: 1117-19 PMID 16557373&lt;/ref&gt;  If protein restriction occurred solely during pregnancy, the F1 and F2 offspring had higher systolic blood pressure and lower nephron numbers, possibly predisposing them to hypertension.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benyshek&quot;/&gt; Altered glucose utilization was detected in the grand-offspring of maternal rats fed a PR-diet during pregnancy and lactation, potentially resulting in diabetes later on in life &lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison&quot;&gt;Harrison M &amp; Langley-Evans SC. Intergenerational programming of impaired nephrogenesis and hypertension in rats following maternal protein restriction during pregnancy. 2009. Br. J. Nutr. 101: 1020-30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Transgenerational ProteinRestrictdiet.jpg|thumb|alt=Protein-restricted (PR) diets fed to maternal mice leads to transgenerational effects in the offspring, up to the F3 generation depending on the length of protein restriction. All offspring are adequately fed, i.e. are not on a PR-diet. Grey mice represent wild-type phenotypes and pink mice represent offspring with either a genetic predisposition to hypertension (maternal rat fed PR-diet during pregnancy) or diabetes (maternal rat fed PR-diet during pregnancy and lactation). Mechanisms behind PR-diets are only proposed, as further research is needed to confirm their exact pathways|Transgenerational effects of maternal protein restriction]]

Protein-restriction in the F0 generation led to hypomethylation of promoters involved in metabolism in the F1 and F2 generations, even though the F1 pregnant rat was given a normal diet.&lt;ref&gt;Burdge GC, Slater-Jefferies J, Torrens C, Phillips ES, Hanson MA &amp; Lillycrop KA. Dietary protein restriction of pregnant rats in the F0 generation induces altered methylation of hepatic gene promoters in the adult male offspring in the F1 and F2 generations. 2007. Br J Nutr 97(3): 435-9 PMID 17313703&lt;/ref&gt;  The exact mechanism of this situation has yet to be elucidated; however, direct transmission is a distinct possibility, meaning the epigenetic marks were preserved during [[spermatogenesis]] and [[oogenesis]], when they are normally erased.

== Models used in nutriepigenomic studies ==
Most research to date use common rodent models to investigate the role of nutrition on [[phenotype]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Simmons&quot;/&gt; Popular areas to investigate include IUGR studies, whereby rodents, and sometimes sheep, are subjected to a variety of nutritional conditions.  A model for studying IUGR in rodent was developed by Simmons et al (2010) and is used to investigate type II diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;Boloker J, Gertz SJ &amp; Simmons RA. Gestational diabetes leads to the development of diabetes in adulthood in the rat. 2002. Diabetes. 51(5): 1499-1506 PMID 11978648.&lt;/ref&gt;  The maternal rats have their uterine arteries ligated, causing altered use of glucose and insulin in the fetus and can therefore serve as a model for diabetes. These growth-retarded rats were found to be highly similar to human fetuses, as they both display symptoms such as lowered glucose and insulin levels.  [[Gestational diabetes]] may also be studied through chemical induction using [[streptozotocin]] treatment of the pregnant rats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fernandez&quot;&gt;Fernandez-Twinn DS &amp; Ozanne SE. Early life nutrition and metabolic programming. Ann N Y Acad Sci. Epub ahead of print 2010 Nov 11 PMID 21070247&lt;/ref&gt; Streptozotocin can cause destruction of the beta cells within the pancreas depending on the concentration given.

The predominant means of investigating nutriepigenetics involves varying the nutritional conditions to which a subject is exposed to and monitoring the effects thereafter.  Restricting caloric and protein intake are the two most common methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fernandez&quot;&gt;Fernandez-Twinn DS &amp; Ozanne SE. Early life nutrition and metabolic programming. Ann N Y Acad Sci. Epub ahead of print 2010 Nov 11&lt;/ref&gt;  A pregnant rodent may have their caloric intake reduced up to 30-50% of normal intake.  Protein restricted rodents are given 8-9% [[casein]], as opposed to control rats that are fed 20% casein. Micronutrients, such as zinc and iron, may also be restricted to investigate the effects on offspring. Additionally, rats fed diets lacking or including methyl donors are often used to study the effects of diet on epigenomics, as variations within the methylation of DNA are common means of silencing or expressing genes.&lt;ref&gt;Niculescu, MD &amp; Zeisel, SH. Diet, methyl donors and DNA methylation: interactions between dietary folate, methionine and choline. 2002. J Nutr. 132, 23335-23355 PMID 12163687&lt;/ref&gt;  Supplementing maternal rats with folic acid, [[vitamin B12]], choline and [[betaine]] leads to increased levels of DNA methylation at CpG sites and causes a coat color change.&lt;ref&gt;Waterland, R. A. &amp; Jirtle, R. L. Transposable elements: targets for early nutritional effects on epigenetic gene regulation. 2003. Mol. Cell. Biol. 23, 5293–5300 {{DOI|10.1128/MCB.23.15.5293-5300.2003}} PMID 12861015.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an example of epigenetically modifiable loci called a “metastable epiallele”, of which only a few have been identified.  The above is an example of the “agouti” gene locus, whereby the insertion of a [[transposable element]] upstream to the Agouti gene is hypermethylated from the supplementation and causes a change in the rat’s coat color. Diets containing higher carbohydrate and fat content attempt to mimic typical Western-style diets may also be used in nutriepigenetic studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simmons&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fernandez&quot;/&gt;  Another method used is “catch-up”, where offspring of rats born to mothers subjected to various diets are subsequently cross-fostered to mothers fed normal diets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fernandez&quot;/&gt;

== Future directions ==
The possibilities of utilizing nutriepigenomics for intervention are quite expansive.  This can include preventative therapies, such as providing an optimal regime for nutrition during pregnancy and lactation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fernandez&quot;/&gt;  It is already common place for pregnant mothers to supplement their diets with choline and folate to prevent the development of neurological disabilities in the fetus. 

[[Image:FAS Choline.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The nutriepigenetic pathway of maternal choline-deficient diets helps to elucidate the development of fetal alcohol syndrome. Pregnant rodents fed diets low in choline were found to give rise to offspring with diminished neurological capacity. This is similar to pregnant rodents whom were fed ethanol and were found to have alterations in the metabolism of 1-carbon compounds. This leads to diminished levels of methyl donors available for methylating DNA; thus allowing for overexpression of normally silenced genes causing neurological defects in their offspring.|The nutriepigenetic pathway of maternal choline-deficient diets helps to elucidate the development of fetal alcohol syndrome]]

A highly specific diet, termed an “EpiG diet”, may be employed for an individual believed to be at higher risk of developing a metabolic disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallou&quot;/&gt; These diets may include supplementation with methyl donors, such as folate. There are also many other natural compounds, such as [[resveratrol]], [[curcumin]] and green tea that have been termed “epigenetic modifiers”, as they have anti-cancer capabilities in addition to being used as treatments for metabolic diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sziv&quot;&gt;Sziv KS, Ndlovu MN, Haegeman G &amp; Vanden Berghe W . Nature or nuture: let food be your epigenetic medicine in chronic inflammatory disorders. 2010. Biochem. Pharmacol. 80(12):1816-32 PMID 20688047&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the functions of these compounds still require long-term studies to evaluate their effect over time.

There also exists potential for therapeutic treatments that may correct metabolic disorders, such as type II diabetes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fernandez&quot;/&gt;  Components of garlic and [[cruciferous vegetables]] are known to possess [[HDAC inhibitors]] that modify the acetylation of histone proteins and may contain a protection against cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;/&gt;  These same compounds have also been implicated in [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS) and [[colon cancer]], as they may modify the histones normally implicated in these diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett M, Bermingham E, McNabb W, Bassett S, Armstrong K, Rounce J &amp; Roy N. Investigating micronutrients and epigenetic mechanisms in relation to inflammatory bowel disease. 2010. Mutat Res. 690(1): 71-80 PMID 20188748&lt;/ref&gt;

Elucidation of disease pathways is another future direction for nutriepigenomic studies.  For example, choline-deficient diets and alcohol metabolism during pregnancy may have very similar metabolic pathways.&lt;ref&gt;Zeisel S. What Choline Metabolism Can Tell Us About the Underlying Mechanisms of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.2011 Mol Neurobiol 2011 Jan 25 epub PMID 21259123&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, animal studies using choline-restricted diets may assist in investigations of [[fetal alcohol spectrum disorders]].

When compared to studies of maternal transmission, investigations into the role of paternal diets are lacking.  A review demonstrated the nutrition of both parents do in fact play a role in determining the health of their offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferguson&quot;&gt;Ferguson-Smith, AC &amp; Patti, ME.

'''Manel Esteller''' ([[Sant Boi de Llobregat]], [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], 1968) graduated in Medicine from the [[University of Barcelona]] in 1992, where he also obtained his doctorate, specialising in the [[molecular genetics]] of endometrial carcinoma, in 1996.  He was an invited researcher at the School of Biological and Medical Sciences at the [[University of St Andrews]], [[Scotland]], during which time his research interests focused on the molecular genetics of inherited breast cancer.

Esteller works on the field of [[epigenetics]] in health and disease.  Starting from identical [[genetic sequence]]s, changes in [[histone]] modifications and [[DNA methylation]] can produce organisms with different features and distinct susceptibility to sickness.  An example is [[Monozygotic_twins#Identical (monozygotic) twins|monozygotic twins]].  To have a complete picture of what is going on with the epigenetic tapestry of our cells, Esteller has advocated the development of a comprehensive [[Human Epigenome Project]] (HEP) to map all the epigenetic marks in our genetic material.  This could have a huge impact in [[cancer]] patients, because we already know that [[Malignancy|malignant cells]] have a profound disregulation of DNA methylation and histone modification patterns.  The good news is that the first pharmacological compounds to &quot;restore&quot; the normal epigenetic landscapes are starting to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/health/05gene.html?_r=1 |title=Explaining Differences in Twins - New York Times |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 July 2005 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://esi-topics.com/genesil2006/interviews/ManelEsteller.html |title=Gene Silencing 2006 - Interview with Dr. Manel Esteller |first= |last=Staff|work=esi-topics.com |date=March 2007|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19938">'''Neuroimmunology''' is a field combining [[neuroscience]], the study of the [[nervous system]], and [[immunology]], the study of the [[immune system]].  Neuroimmunologists seek to better understand the interactions of these two complex systems during development, homeostasis, and response to injuries.  A long-term goal of this rapidly developing research area is to further develop our understanding of the pathology of certain neurological [[diseases]], some of which have no clear [[etiology]]. In doing so, neuroimmunology contributes to development of new pharmacological treatments for several neurological conditions.  Many types of interactions involve both the nervous and immune systems including but not limited to the [[physiological]] functioning of the two systems in both [[health]] and disease, malfunction of either and or both systems that leads to disorders, and the physical, chemical, and environmental stressors that affect the two systems on a daily basis.

==Background==

Neural targets that control [[thermogenesis]], [[behavior]], [[sleep]], and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] can be affected by pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s which are released by activated [[macrophages]] and [[monocytes]] during infection. Within the [[central nervous system]] production of cytokines has been detected as a result of brain injury, during [[virus|viral]] and [[bacterial]] infections, and in [[neurodegenerative]] processes.

From the US National Institute of Health:&lt;ref&gt;[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/pa-05-054.html Functional Links between the Immune System, Brain Function and Behavior]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Despite the [[brain]]'s status as an immune privileged site, an extensive bi-directional communication takes place between the nervous and the [[immune system]] in both health and disease. Immune cells and neuroimmune molecules such as cytokines, [[chemokines]], and growth factors modulate brain function through multiple signaling pathways throughout the lifespan. Immunological, physiological and psychological stressors engage cytokines and other immune molecules as mediators of interactions with [[neuroendocrine]], neuropeptide, and [[neurotransmitter]] systems. For example, brain cytokine levels increase following stress exposure, while treatments designed to alleviate [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] reverse this effect.

&quot;Neuroinflammation and neuroimmune activation have been shown to play a role in the etiology of a variety of neurological disorders such as stroke, Parkinson's and [[Alzheimer's]] disease, [[multiple sclerosis]], [[pain]], and AIDS-associated [[dementia]]. However, [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s also modulate CNS function in the absence of overt immunological, physiological, or psychological challenges. For example, cytokines and cytokine receptor inhibitors affect cognitive and emotional processes. Recent evidence suggests that immune molecules modulate brain systems differently across the lifespan. Cytokines and chemokines regulate [[neurotrophins]] and other molecules critical to neurodevelopmental processes, and exposure to certain neuroimmune challenges early in life affects brain development. In adults, cytokines and chemokines affect [[synapse|synaptic]] plasticity and other ongoing neural processes, which may change in aging brains. Finally, interactions of immune molecules with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal system indicate that sex differences are a significant factor determining the impact of neuroimmune influences on brain function and behavior.&quot;

Recent research demonstrates that reduction of lymphocyte populations can impair cognition in mice, and that restoration of lymphocytes restores cognitive abilities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kipnis J, Derecki NC, Yang C, Scrable H |title=Immunity and cognition: what do age-related dementia, HIV-dementia and 'chemo-brain' have in common? |journal=Trends Immunol. |volume=29 |issue=10 |pages=455–63 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18789764 |doi=10.1016/j.it.2008.07.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epigenetics of neuroimmunology==

===Overview===
[[Epigenetic]] medicine encompasses a new branch of neuroimmunology that studies the brain and behavior. This new branch has already provided unique insights into the mechanisms underlying [[brain development]], [[evolution]], [[neuronal]] and network plasticity and homeostasis, [[senescence]], the [[etiology]] of diverse [[neurological diseases]] and neural regenerative processes.  This new study is leading to the discovery of environmental stressors that dictate initiation of specific neurological disorders and specific disease [[biomarker]]s.  The goal of this is to “promote accelerated recovery of impaired and seemingly irrevocably lost cognitive, behavioral, sensorimotor functions through epigenetic reprogramming of [[endogenous]] regional neural [[stem cells]] &lt;ref&gt;Abdolmaleky, H.M., Thiagalingam, S., Wilcox, M., 2005. Genetics and epigenetics in major psychiatric disorders: dilemmas, achievements, applications, and future scope. American Journal of Pharmacogenomics 5, 149–160.&lt;/ref&gt;.”  Understanding epigenetic medicine is important to understanding possible future pharmacological treatments.  Many of the immediate gaps in [[knowledge]] are attributed to basic lack of understanding of [[gene expression]] and regulation and are thus the limiting factors for creating advanced treatments or cures to many diseases.  To better understand these processes, neuroimmunological experiments are being created and tested to once and for all amass a more complete [[anthology]] of knowledge pertaining to the complex interactions between the nervous and immune systems along with that of gene expression.  While some disorders may affect the nervous and immune systems independently of one another, it is impossible to truly understand neuroimmnulogical science without a complex understanding of how each system works independently and also how they work together.

===Neural stem cell fate===

Several studies have shown that regulation of stem cell maintenance and the subsequent fate determinations are quite complex.  The complexity of determining the fate of a stem cell can be best understood by knowing the “circuitry employed to orchestrate stem cell maintenance and progressive neural fate decisions &lt;ref&gt;Diamandis, P., Wildenhain, J., Clarke, I.D., Sacher, A.G., Graham, J., Bellows, D.S., Ling, E.K., Ward, R.J., Jamieson, L.G., Tyers, M., Dirks, P.B., 2007. Chemical genetics reveals a complex functional ground state of neural stem cells. Nat. Chem. Biol. 3, 268–273.&lt;/ref&gt;.”  Neural fate decisions include the utilization of multiple neurotransmitter signal pathways along with the use of epigenetic regulators.  The advancement of neuronal stem cell differentiation and glial fate decisions must be orchestrated timely to determine subtype specification and subsequent maturation processes including myelination &lt;ref&gt;Shen, S., Casaccia-Bonnefil, P., 2007. Post-translational modifications of nucleosomal histones in oligodendrocyte lineage cells in development and disease. Journal of Molecular Neuroscience. 35, 13–22.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

===Neurodevelopmental disorders===

Neurodevelopmental disorders result from impairments of growth and development of the brain and nervous system and lead to many disorders.  Examples of these disorders include [[Asperger syndrome]], [[traumatic brain injury]], [[communication]], speech and language disorders, genetic disorders such as [[fragile-X syndrome]], [[Down syndrome]], [[epilepsy]], and [[fetal alcohol syndrome]]. Studies have shown that [[autism spectrum disorders]] (ASDs) may in fact be due to basic disorders of epigenetic regulation &lt;ref&gt;Herbert, M.R., Russo, J.P., Yang, S., Roohi, J., Blaxill, M., Kahler, S.G., Cremer, L., Hatchwell, E., 2006. Autism and environmental genomics. Neurotoxicology 27, 671–684.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Other neuroimmunological research has shown that deregulation of correlated epigenetic processes in ASDs can alter gene expression and brain function without causing classical genetic lesions which are more easily attributable to a cause and effect relationship &lt;ref&gt;Badcock, C., Crespi, B., 2006. Imbalanced genomic imprinting in brain development: an evolutionary basis for the aetiology of autism. Journal of Evolutionary Biology. 19, 1007–1032.&lt;/ref&gt;.  These findings are some of the numerous recent discoveries in previously unknown areas of gene misexpression.

===Neurodegenerative disorders===

Increasing evidence suggests that neurodegenerative diseases are mediated by erroneous epigenetic mechanisms.  Neurodegenerative diseases include [[Huntington’s disease]] and [[Alzheimer’s disease]]. Neuroimmunological research into these diseases has yielded evidence including the absence of simple Mendelian inheritance patterns, global transcriptional dysregulation, multiple types of pathogenic [[RNA alterations]], and many more &lt;ref&gt;Greene, L.A., Liu, D.X., Troy, C.M., Biswas, S.C., 2007. Cell cycle molecules define a pathway required for neuron death in development and disease. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta. 1772, 392–401.&lt;/ref&gt;.  In one of the experiments, a treatment of Huntington’s disease with histone deacetylases (HDAC), an enzyme that removes acetyl groups from lysine, and DNA/RNA binding anthracylines that affect nucleosome positioning, showed positive effects on behavioral measures, neuroprotection, nuclesome remodeling, and associated chromatin dynamics &lt;ref&gt;Abel, T., Zukin, R.S., 2008. Epigenetic targets of HDAC inhibition in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Current Opinion in Pharmacology. 8, 57–64.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Another new finding on neurodegenerative diseases involves the overexpression of HDAC6 suppresses the neurodegenerative phenotype associated with Alzheimer’s disease pathology in associated animal models &lt;ref&gt;Pandey, U.B., Nie, Z., Batlevi, Y., McCray, B.A., Ritson, G.P., Nedelsky, N.B., Schwartz, S.L., DiProspero, N.A., Knight, M.A., Schuldiner, O., Padmanabhan, R., Hild, M., Berry, D.L., Garza, D., Hubbert, C.C., Yao, T.P., Baehrecke, E.H., Taylor, J.P., 2007. HDAC6 rescues neurodegeneration and provides an essential link between autophagy and the UPS. Nature 447, 859–863.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Other findings show that additional mechanisms are responsible for the “underlying transcriptional and post-transcriptional dysregulation and complex chromatin abnormalities in Huntington’s disease &lt;ref&gt;Ballas, N., Mandel, G., 2005. The many faces of REST oversee epigenetic programming of neuronal genes. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 15, 500–506.&lt;/ref&gt;.”

===Neuroimmunological disorders===

The nervous and immune systems have many interactions that dictate overall body health.  The nervous system is under constant monitoring from both the [[adaptive]] and [[innate immune system]].  Throughout development and adult life, the immune system detects and responds to changes in [[cell identity]] and neural connectivity &lt;ref&gt;Bailey, S.L., Carpentier, P.A., McMahon, E.J., Begolka, W.S., Miller, S.D., 2006. Innate and adaptive immune responses of the central nervous system. Critical Reviews in Immunology. 26, 149–188.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Deregulation of both adaptive and acquired immune responses, impairment of crosstalk between these two systems, as well as alterations in the deployment of innate immune mechanisms can predispose the central nervous system (CNS) to autoimmunity and neurodegeneration &lt;ref&gt;Hauser, S.L., Oksenberg, J.R., 2006. The neurobiology of multiple sclerosis: genes, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. Neuron 52, 61–76.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Other evidence has shown that development and deployment of the innate and acquired immune systems in response to stressors on functional integrity of cellular and systemic level and the evolution of autoimmunity are mediated by [[epigenetic mechanisms]] &lt;ref&gt;Sawalha, A.H., 2008. Epigenetics and T-cell immunity. Autoimmunity 41, 245–252.&lt;/ref&gt;.    Autoimmunity has been increasingly linked to targeted deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms, and therefore, use of epigenetic therapeutic agents may help reverse complex pathogenic processes &lt;ref&gt;Gray, S.G., Dangond, F., 2006. Rationale for the use of histone [[deacetylase]] inhibitors as a dual therapeutic modality in multiple sclerosis. Epigenetics 1, 67–75.&lt;/ref&gt;.  [[Multiple sclerosis]] (MS) is one type of neuroimmunological disorder that affects many people.  MS features CNS inflammation, immune-mediated demyelination and neurodegeneration, and may represent an emerging class of epigenetic disorders &lt;ref&gt;Brooks, W.H., 2005. Autoimmune disorders result from loss of epigenetic control following chromosome damage. Medical Hypotheses 64, 590–598.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Major themes of research==

The interaction of the CNS and immune system are fairly well known.  Burn-induced organ dysfunction using vagus nerve stimulation has been found to attenuate organ and serum cytokine levels.  Burns generally induce abacterial cytokine generation and perhaps parasympathetic stimulation after burns would decrease cardiodepressive mediator generation.  Multiple groups have produced experimental evidence that support proinflammatory cytokine production being the central element of the burn-induced stress response &lt;ref&gt;S.L. Oke and K.J. Tracey, 2008. From CNI-1493 to the immunological homunculus: physiology of the inflammatory reflex, Journal of Leukocyte Biology 83, 512–517.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Still other groups have shown that vagus nerve signaling has a prominent impact on various inflammatory pathologies.  These studies have laid the groundwork for inquiries that vagus nerve stimulation may influence postburn immunological responses and thus can ultimately be used to limit organ damage and failure from burn induced stress. 

Basic understanding of neuroimmunological diseases has changed significantly during the last ten years. New data broadening the understanding of new treatment concepts has been obtained for a large number of neuroimmunological diseases, none more so than multiple sclerosis, since many efforts have been undertaken recently to clarify the complexity of pathomechanisms of this disease.  Accumulating evidence from animal studies suggests that some aspects of depression and fatigue in MS may be linked to inflammatory markers &lt;ref&gt;Gold, Stefan M, Irwin, Michael R, 2009. Depression and Immunity: Inflammation and Depressive Symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis. 29, 309.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Research into the link between smell, depressive behavior, and autoimmunity has turned up interesting findings including the facts that inflammation is common in all of the diseases analyzed, depressive symptoms appear early in the course of most diseases, smell impairment is also apparent early in the development of neurological conditions, and all of the diseases involved the amygdale and hippocampus.  Better understanding of how the immune system functions and what factors contribute to responses are being heavily investigated along with the aforementioned coincidences.

==Future directions==

The nervous system and immune system require the appropriate degrees of cellular differentiation, organizational integrity, and neural network connectivity.  These operational features of the brain and nervous system may make signaling difficult to duplicate in severely diseased scenarios.  There are currently three classes of therapies that have been utilized in both animal models of disease and in human clinical trials.  These three classes include DNA methylation inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, and RNA-based approaches.  DNA methylation inhibitors are used to activate previously silenced genes.  HDACs are a class of enzymes that have a broad set of biochemical modifications and can affect DNA demethylation and synergy with other therapeutic agents.  The final therapy includes using RNA-based approaches to enhance stability, specificity, and efficacy, especially in diseases that are caused by RNA alterations.  Emerging concepts concerning the complexity and versatility of the epigenome may suggest ways to target genomewide cellular processes.  Other studies suggest that eventual seminal regulator targets may be identified allowing with alterations to the massive epigenetic reprogramming during gametogenesis.  Many future treatments may extend beyond being purely therapeutic and may in fact be determined to be preventative perhaps in the form of a vaccine.  Newer high throughput technologies when combined with advances in imaging modalities such as in vivo optical nanotechnologies may give rise to even greater knowledge of genomic architecture, nuclear organization, and the interplay between the immune and nervous systems.  &lt;ref&gt;Rauch, J., Knoch, T.A., Solovei, I., Teller, K., Stein, S., Buiting, K., Horsthemke, B., Langowski, J., Cremer, T., Hausmann, M., Cremer, C., 2008. Light optical precision measurements of the active and inactive Prader-Willi syndrome imprinted regions in human cell nuclei. Differentiation 76, 66–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1635">'''Epigenetic landscape''' is a [[metaphor]] for [[morphogenesis|biological development]]. Its originator, [[Conrad Hal Waddington]], said that [[Cell (biology)|cell]] fates were established in development much like a marble rolls down to the point of [[local optimum|lowest local elevation]].&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, Conrad H. 1953. The Epigenetics of birds. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Waddington suggested visualising increasing irreversibility of cell type differentiation as ridges rising between the valleys where the marbles (cells) are travelling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/utils/fref.fcgi?PrId=3058&amp;itool=Abstract-def&amp;uid=14760651&amp;nlmid=101168228&amp;db=pubmed&amp;url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jez.b.20002] Hall BK. 2004.

Today, the term refers to the combined epigenetic modifications of a given domain of [[DNA]] sequence. Epigenetic modifications include [[methylation]] of [[cytosine]] residues of DNA and post-translational modifications of the [[histone]] proteins associated with the DNA strand. The specific combination of epigenetic modifications determines the conformation of the [[chromatin]] fibre into which the DNA and histones are packaged, and can thereby regulate the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]al potential of the underlying [[gene]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24259">'''Epigenomics''' is the study of the complete set of [[epigenetic]] modifications on the genetic material of a cell, known as the [[epigenome]]. The field is analogous to [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]], which are the study of the genome and proteome of a cell (Russell 2010 p. 217 &amp; 230).  Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell’s DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence (Russell 2010 p. 475).  Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are [[DNA methylation]] and [[Epigenetics#DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling|histone modification]].  Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in [[Epigenetics#Development|differentiation/development]] and [[Epigenetics#Cancer and developmental abnormalities|tumorigenesis]] (Russell 2010 p. 597).  The study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic high-throughput assays (Laird 2010).

==Introduction to Epigenetics==
The mechanisms governing [[phenotypic plasticity]], or the capacity of a cell to change its state in response to stimuli, have long been the subject of research (Phenotypic plasticity 1).   The traditional [[central dogma of molecular biology|central dogma of biology]] states that the DNA of a cell is transcribed to [[RNA]], which is translated to [[protein|proteins]], which perform cellular processes and functions (Crick 1970).  A paradox exists, however, in that cells exhibit diverse responses to varying stimuli and that cells sharing identical sets of DNA such as in multicellular organisms can have a variety of distinct functions and phenotypes (Bird 2002).   Classical views have attributed phenotypic variation to differences in primary DNA structure, be it through aberrant [[mutation]] or an inherited sequence [[allele]] (Johannes 2008).  However, while this did explain some aspects of variation, it does not explain how tightly coordinated and regulated cellular responses, such as differentiation, are carried out.

A more likely source of cellular plasticity is through the [[Regulation of gene expression]], such that while two cells may have near identical DNA, the differential expression of certain genes results in variation.  Research has shown that cells are capable of regulating gene expression at [[Regulation of gene expression#Regulated stages of gene expression|several stages]]: mRNA transcription, processing and transportation as well as in protein translation, post-translational processing and degradation.   Regulatory proteins that bind to DNA, RNA, and/or proteins are key effectors in these processes and function by positively or negatively regulating specific protein level and function in a cell (Russell 2010 p 518-19).  And, while DNA binding transcription factors provide a mechanism for specific control of cellular responses, a model where DNA binding [[transcription factor|transcription factors]] are the sole regulators of gene activity is also unlikely.   For example, in a study of [[Somatic-cell nuclear transfer]], it was demonstrated that stable features of differentiation remain after the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] is transferred to a new cellular environment, suggesting that a stable and heritable mechanism of gene regulation was involved in the maintenance of the differentiated state in the absence of the DNA binding transcription factors (Bird 2002).

With the finding that DNA methylation and histone modifications are stable, heritable, and also reversible processes that influence gene expression without altering DNA primary structure, a mechanism for the observed variability in cell gene expression was provided (Johannes 2008).  These modifications were termed epigenetic, from epi “on top of” the genetic material “DNA” (Epigenetics 1).  The mechanisms governing epigenetic modifications are complex, but through the advent of [[DNA sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|high-throughput sequencing technology]] they are now becoming better understood (Johannes 2008).  

==Epigenetics==
Genomic modifications that alter gene expression that cannot be attributed to modification of the primary DNA sequence and that are heritable [[mitosis|mitotically]] and [[Meiosis|meiotically]] classified as epigenetic modifications.  DNA methylation and histone modification are among the best characterized epigenetic processes (Russell 2010 p. 475).   

===DNA methylation===
The first epigenetic modification to be characterized in depth was DNA methylation.   As its name implies, DNA methylation is the process by which a [[methyl group]] is added to DNA.  The enzymes responsible for catalyzing this reaction are the [[DNA methyltransferase|DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)]].  While DNA methylation is stable and heritable, it can be reversed by an antagonistic group of enzymes known as DNA de-methylases.   In eukaryotes, methylation is most commonly found on the carbon 5 position of [[cytosine|cytosine residues]] (5mC) adjacent to [[guanine]], termed [[CpG site|CpG dinucleotides]] (Russell 2010 p 531-32; Laird 2010).     
DNA methylation patterns vary greatly between species and even within the same organism.  The usage of methylation among animals is quite different; with [[vertebrate|vertebrates]] exhibiting the highest levels of 5mC and [[invertebrate|invertebrates]] more moderate levels of 5mC.   Some organisms like ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' have not been demonstrated to have 5mC nor a conventional DNA methyltransferase; this would suggest that other mechanisms other than DNA methylation are also involved (Bird 2002).

Within an organism, DNA methylation levels can also vary throughout development and by region.  For example, in mouse primordial [[Germ cell|germ cells]], a genome wide de-methylation even occurs; by implantation stage, methylation levels return to their prior somatic levels (Bird 2002).  When DNA methylation occurs at [[Promoter (biology)|promoter regions]], the sites of transcription initiation, it has the effect of repressing gene expression.   This is in contrast to unmethylated promoter regions which are associated with actively expressed genes (Laird 2010).

The mechanism by which DNA methylation represses gene expression is a multi-step process.  The distinction between methylated and unmethylated cytosine residues is carried out by specific DNA-binding proteins.   Binding of these proteins recruit [[Histone deacetylase|histone deacetylases (HATs)]] enzyme which initiate [[Epigenetics#DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling|chromatin remodeling]] such that the DNA becoming less accessible to transcriptional machinery, such as [[RNA polymerase]], effectively repressing gene expression (Russell 2010 p.532-533).

===Histone Modification===
In [[eukaryote|eukaryotes]], genomic DNA is coiled into protein-DNA complexes called [[chromatin]].   [[Histone|Histones]], which are the most prevalent type of protein found in chromatin, function to condense the DNA; the net positive charge on histones facilitates their bonding with DNA, which is negatively charged.  The basic and repeating units of chromatin, [[Nucleosome|nucleosomes]], consist of an [[histone octamer|octamer of histone proteins]] (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) and a 146 bp length of DNA wrapped around it.  Nucleosomes and the DNA connecting form a 10 nm diameter chromatin fiber, which can be further condensed (Barski et al. 2007; Kouzarides 2007).

Chromatin packaging of DNA varies depending on the cell cycle stage and by local DNA region (Russell 2010 p. 24-27).  The degree to which chromatin is condensed is associated with a certain transcriptional state.   Unpackaged or loose chromatin is more transcriptionally active than tightly packaged chromatin because it is more accessible to transcriptional machinery.  By remodeling chromatin structure and changing the density of DNA packaging, gene expression can thus be modulated (Kouzarides 2007).

Chromatin remodeling occurs via [[Posttranslational modification|post-translational modifications]] of the [[Nucleosome#Histone tail domains|N-terminal tails of core histone proteins]] (Russell 2010 p. 529-30).   The collective set of histone modifications in a given cell is known as the [[histone code]].  Many different types of histone modification are known, including: [[acetylation]], [[methylation]], [[phosphorylation]], [[ubiquitin|ubiquitination]], [[SUMO protein|SUMOylation]], [[ADP-ribosylation]], [[Citrullination|deamination]] and [[proline|proline isomerization]]; acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination have been implicated in gene activation whereas methylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, deamination and proline isomerization have been implicated in gene repression.  Note that several modification types including methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination can be associated with different transcriptional states depending on the specific amino acid on the histone being modified.  Furthermore, the DNA region where histone modification occurs can also elicit different effects; an example being methylation of the 3rd core histone at lysine residue 36 (H3K36).  When H3K36 occurs in the coding sections of a gene, it is associated with gene activation but the opposite is found when it is within the promoter region (Kouzarides 2007). 

Histone modifications regulate gene expression by two mechanisms: by [[Nucleosome#Histone post-translational modifications|disruption of the contact between nucleosomes]] and by [[Nucleosome#ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelling|recruiting chromatin remodeling ATPases]].   An example of the first mechanism occurs during the acetylation of [[lysine]] terminal tail amino acids, which is catalyzed by [[Histone acetyltransferase|histone acetyltransferases (HATs)]].  HATs are part of a multiprotein complex that is recruited to chromatin when activators bind to DNA binding sites.  Acetylation effectively neutralizes the basic charge on lysine, which was involved in stabilizing chromatin through its affinity for negatively charged DNA.   Acetylated histones therefore favor the dissociation of nucleosomes and thus unwinding of chromatin can occur.  Under a loose chromatin state, DNA is more accessible to transcriptional machinery and thus expression is activated.  The process can be reversed through removal of histone acetyl groups by deacetylases (Kouzarides 2007; Russell 2010 p. 529-30).  

The second process involves the recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes by the binding of activator molecules to corresponding enhancer regions.  The nucleosome remodeling complexes reposition nucleosomes by several mechanisms, enabling or disabling accessibility of transcriptional machinery to DNA.  The [[SWI/SNF|SWI/SNF protein complex]] in yeast is one example of a chromatin remodeling complex that regulates the expression of many genes through chromatin remodeling  (Kouzarides 2007; Russell 2010 p. 530).

==Relation to other genomic fields==
Epigenomics shares many commonalities with other genomics fields, in both methodology and in its abstract purpose.  Epigenomics seeks to identify and characterize epigenetic modifications on a global level, similar to the study of the complete set of DNA in genomics or the complete set of proteins in a cell in proteomics (Russell 2010 p. 217 &amp; 230).   The logic behind performing epigenetic analysis on a global level is that inferences can be made about epigenetic modifications, which might not be otherwise be possible through analysis of specific loci (Barski et al. 2007; Russell 2010 p. 217).   As in the other genomics fields, epigenomics relies heavily on [[bioinformatics]], which combines the disciplines of biology, mathematics and computer science (Russell 2010 p. 218).  However while epigenetic modifications had been known and studied for decades, it is through these advancements in bioinformatics technology that have allowed analyses on a global scale.  Many current techniques still draw on older methods, often adapting them to genomic assays as is described in the next section.  

==Methods of Epigenomics==	
===Histone modification assays===
The cellular processes of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[DNA replication]] and [[DNA repair]] involve the interaction between genomic DNA and nuclear proteins.   It had been known that certain regions within chromatin were extremely susceptible to [[Deoxyribonuclease|DNAse I]] digestion, which cleaves DNA in a low sequence specificity manner.  Such [[hypersensitive sites]] were thought to be transcriptionally active regions, as evidenced by their association with [[RNA polymerase]] and [[topoisomerase|topoisomerases I and II]] (Gross 1988). 
   
It is now know that sensitivity to DNAse I regions correspond to regions of chromatin with loose DNA-histone association.   Hypersensitive sites most often represent promoters regions, which require for DNA to be accessible for DNA binding transcriptional machinery to function (Russell 2010 p. 529).
            
====ChIP-Chip and ChIP-Seq====
Histone modification was first detected on a genome wide level through the coupling of [[Chromatin immunoprecipitation|chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)]] technology with [[DNA microarray|DNA microarrays]], termed [[ChIP-Chip]] (Barski et al. 2007).  However instead of isolating a DNA-binding transcription factor or enhancer protein through chromatin immunoprecipitation, the proteins of interest are the modified histones themselves.   First, histones are [[Chromatin immunoprecipitation#Cross-linked ChIP (XChIP)|cross-linked]] to DNA in vivo through light chemical treatment (e.g., [[formaldehyde]]).  The cells are next lysed, allowing for the chromatin to be extracted and fragmented, either by [[sonication]] or treatment with a non-specific restriction enzyme (e.g., [[micrococcal nuclease]]).  Modification-specific antibodies in turn, are used to immunoprecipitate the DNA-histone complexes (Kouzarides 2007).  Following immunoprecipitation, the DNA is purified from the histones, amplified via PCR and labeled with a [[fluorescent tag]] (e.g., [[Fluorophore#CyDyes|Cy5, Cy3]]).  The final step involves hybridization of labeled DNA, both immunoprecipitated DNA and non-immunoprecipitated onto a microarray containing immobilized gDNA.  Analysis of the relative signal intensity allows the sites of histone modification to be determined (Gibson 2009 229-230; Russell 2010 p. 532).  

ChIP-chip was used extensively to characterize the global histone modification patterns of [[yeast]].   From these studies, inferences on the function of histone modifications were made; that transcriptional activation or repression was associated with certain histone modifications and by region.  While this method was effective providing near full coverage of the yeast epigenome, its use in larger genomes such as humans is limited (Kouzarides 2007; Barski et al. 2007).  

In order to study histone modifications on a truly genome level, other high-throughput methods were coupled with the chromatin immunoprecipitation, namely: [[serial analysis of gene expression|SAGE: serial analysis of gene expression]] (ChIP-SAGE), [[Paired-end tags|PET: paired end ditag sequencing]]  ([[Paired-end tags#PET Applications|ChIP-PET]]) and more recently, next-generation sequencing [[Chip-Sequencing|(ChIP-Seq)]].  ChIP-seq follows the same protocol for chromatin immunoprecipitation but instead of amplification of purified DNA and hybridization to a microarray, the DNA fragments are directly sequenced using next generation parallel re-sequencing.  It has proven to be an effective method for analyzing the global histone modification patterns and protein target sites, providing higher resolution than previous methods (Barski et al. 2007; Gibson 2009 229-232).

===DNA Methylation assays===
Techniques for characterizing primary DNA sequences could not be directly applied to methylation assays.  For example, when DNA was amplified in [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] or bacterial cloning techniques, the methylation pattern was not copied and thus the information lost.  The [[ hybridization probe|DNA hybridization technique]] used in DNA assays, in which radioactive probes were used to map and identify DNA sequences, could not be used to distinguish between methylated and non-methylated DNA (Laird 2010; Eads 2000).  

====Restriction endonuclease based methods====
=====Non genome-wide approaches=====
The earliest methylation detection assays used methylation modification sensitive [[restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]].   Genomic DNA was digested with both methylation-sensitive and insensitive restriction enzymes recognizing the same restriction site.  The idea being that whenever the site was methylated, only the methylation insensitive enzyme could cleave at that position.   By comparing [[restriction fragment]] sizes generated from the methylation-sensitive enzyme to those of the methylation-insensitive enzyme, it was possible to determine the methylation pattern of the region.  This analysis step was done by amplifying the restriction fragments via PCR, separating them through [[gel electrophoresis]] and analyzing them via [[southern blot]] with probes for the region of interest (Eads et al. 2000; Laird 2010)).    

This technique was used to compare the DNA methylation modification patterns in the human adult and [[human β-globin locus|hemoglobin gene loci]].  Different regions of the gene (gamma delta beta globin) were known to be expressed at different stages of development (Russell 2010 p. 552-3).  Consistent with a role of DNA methylation in gene repression, regions that were associated with high levels of DNA methylation were not actively expressed (Van der Ploeg et al. 1980).  

This method was limited not suitable for studies on the global methylation pattern, or ‘methylome’.  Even within specific loci it was not fully representative of the true methylation pattern as only those restriction sites with corresponding methylation sensitive and insensitive restriction assays could provide useful information.   Further complications could arise when incomplete digestion of DNA by restriction enzymes generated false negative results (Laird 2010).

=====Genome wide approaches=====
DNA methylation profiling on a large scale was first made possible through the [[Restriction landmark genomic scanning|Restriction Landmark Genome Scanning (RLGS)]] technique.  Like the locus-specific DNA methylation assay, the technique identified methylated DNA via its digestion methylation sensitive enzymes.   However it was the use of [[two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] that allowed be characterized on a broader scale (Laird 2010).  

However it was not until the advent of microarray and next generation sequencing technology when truly high resolution and genome-wide DNA methylation became possible (Johannes 2008).   As with RLGS, the endonuclease component is retained in the method but it is coupled to new technologies.  One such approach is the differential methylation hybridization (DMH), in which one set of genomic DNA is digested with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes and a parallel set of DNA is not digested.  Both sets of DNA are subsequently amplified and each labelled with fluorescent dyes and used in two-colour array hybridization. The level of DNA methylation at a given loci is determined by the relative intensity ratios of the two dyes.   Adaptation of next generation sequencing to DNA methylation assay provides several advantages over array hybridization.  Sequence-based technology provides higher resolution to allele specific DNA methylation, can be performed on larger genomes, and does not require creation of DNA microarrays which require adjustments based on CpG density to properly function (Laird 2010).     

====Bisulfite sequencing====
[[Bisulfite sequencing]] relies on chemical conversion of methylated cytosines exclusively, such that they can be identified through standard DNA sequencing techniques.  [[bisulfite|Sodium bisulfate]] and alkaline treatment does this, by converting methylated cytosine residues into [[uracil]], while leaving methylated cytosine unaltered.  Subsequent amplification and sequencing of untreated DNA and sodium bisulphite treated DNA allows for methylated sites to be identified.  Bisulfite sequencing, like the traditional restriction based methods was historically limited to methylation patterns of specific gene loci, until whole genome sequencing technologies became available.  However unlike traditional restriction based methods, bisulfite sequencing provided resolution on a nucleotide level (Eads 2000; Laird 2010).

[[Bisulfite sequencing#Limitations|Limitations of the bisulfite technique]] include the incomplete conversion of cytosine to uracil, which is a source of false positives.  Further, bisulfite treatment also causes DNA degradation and requires an additional purification step to remove the sodium bisulphite (Laird 2010).  

Next generation sequencing is well suited in complementing bisulfite sequencing in [[Bisulfite sequencing#Applications: genome-wide methylation analysis|genome-wide methylation analysis]].  While this now allows for methylation pattern to be determined on the highest resolution possible, on the single nucleotide level, challenges still remain in the assembly step because of reduced sequence complexity in bisulphite treated DNA.   Increases in read length seek to address this challenge, allowing for whole genome shotgun bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) to be performed.  The WGBS approach using an Illumina Genome Analyzer platform and has already been implemented in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' (Laird 2010).

'''Soft inheritance''' is the term for a largely discredited set of theories.  It was coined by [[Ernst Mayr]] to include such ideas as [[Lamarckism]], that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring. It contrasts with modern ideas of [[Biological inheritance|inheritance]], which Mayr called [[hard inheritance]]. Since [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]], modern genetics has held that the hereditary material is impervious to environmental influences (except, of course, mutagenic effects).&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richards EJ |title=Inherited epigenetic variation—revisiting soft inheritance |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=395–401 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16534512 |doi=10.1038/nrg1834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In soft inheritance &quot;the genetic basis of characters could be modified either by direct induction by the environment, or by use and disuse, or by an intrinsic failure of constancy, and that this modified genotype was then transmitted to the next generation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst W. Mayr |editor=Provine, William B.; Mayr, Ernst |title=The Evolutionary synthesis: perspectives on the unification of biology |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1980 |pages=1–48 |isbn=0-674-27225-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;Concepts of soft inheritance are usually associated with the ideas of [[Lamarck]] and [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy]]. The concept of [[hard inheritance]] holds sway today, as Mayr points out.

One of the first statements in favour of hard inheritance was made by the English surgeon [[William Lawrence (biologist)|William Lawrence]] in 1819. His ideas on heredity were many years ahead of their time, as this extract shows: &quot;The offspring inherit only [their parents'] connate peculiarities and not any of the acquired qualities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lawrence, William FRS. |title=Lectures on physiology, zoology and the natural history of man |publisher=J. Callow |location=London |year=1819 }} There were a number of unauthorized reprints of this work, pirated (in the sense that the author went unrecompensed) but seemingly unexpurgated. These editions also lacked the protection of copyright, and date from 1819 and 1848. Some of them were by quite respectable publishers&lt;/ref&gt; This is as clear a rejection of soft inheritance as one can find. However, Lawrence qualified it by including the origin of birth defects owing to influences on the mother (an old folk superstition). So [[Ernst Mayr|Mayr]] places [[Wilhelm His, Sr.]] in 1874 as the first unqualified rejection of soft inheritance. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=His W. |authorlink=Wilhelm His, Sr. |title=Unsere Körperform und das physiologische Problem ihrer Enstehung |publisher=Vogel |location=Leipzig |year=1874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst W. Mayr |title=The growth of biological thought: diversity, evolution, and inheritance |publisher=Belknap Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1982 |page=695 |isbn=0-674-36445-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[August Weismann]], in 1883, gave a comprehensive denial of [[Lamarckism]] (soft inheritance) and with his distinction between germ and soma provided a general ideology of hard inheritance which survives to the present day.

Recent work in plants and mammals on the role of the environment on [[epigenetic]] modifications of [[DNA]] have led to the argument that [[Transgenerational epigenetics|inherited epigenetic variation]] is a kind of soft inheritance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards&quot;/&gt;{{nofootnotes|date=January 2012}}  This, however, is not one of the ideas explored in any detail in Mayr.  Epigenetics does not claim that newly acquired traits can be directly transmitted to offspring without the mechanism of genetics (which was Lamarck's claim&lt;ref&gt;Jurmain, Robert, Lynn Kilgore et al.  Introduction to Physical Anthropology.  Wadsworth 2011.  Pp. 29-39.&lt;/ref&gt;, but instead highlights the notion that the environment can help set up the functioning of existing genes.  The notion that such change in the functioning of existing genes can lead to actual changes in the structure of genes remains highly controversial.  Whether the term &quot;soft inheritance&quot; emerges as a term to capture the phenomena under study in epigenetics remains to be seen.  Currently, it is difficult to find reputable scientific sources that use the term &quot;soft inheritance&quot; to refer to the studies (particularly on plants) that show that future genetic structures (not necessarily mutations) can be affected by past environmental events, except in the usual sense given in Darwin's theory of [[Natural Selection]].  Epigenetics, rather than soft inheritance, seems to be favored at academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17283">[[Image:Weiselzellen 68a.jpg|thumb|300px|Developing queen larvae surrounded by royal jelly]]

'''Royal jelly''' is a [[honey bee]] secretion that is used in the nutrition of [[larva]]e and adult [[Queen bee|queens]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Hoffmann L: Die Determination von Königin und Arbeiterin der Honigbiene. Z Bienenforsch 1966, 8:296-322.&lt;/ref&gt; It is secreted from the [[gland]]s in the [[Insect_mouthparts#Hypopharynx|hypopharynx]] of worker bees, and fed to all larvae in the colony.&lt;ref name = &quot;Graham&quot;&gt;Graham, J. (ed.) (1992) ''The Hive and the Honey Bee'' (Revised Edition). Dadant &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

When worker bees decide to make a new queen, either because the old one is weakening, or was killed, they choose several small larvae and feed them with copious amounts of royal jelly in specially constructed queen cells. This type of feeding triggers the development of queen morphology, including the fully developed [[ovary|ovaries]] needed to lay eggs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maleszka, R 2008&quot;&gt;Maleszka, R, Epigenetic integration of environmental and genomic signals in honey bees: the critical interplay of nutritional, brain and reproductive networks. Epigenetics. 2008, 3, 188-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultivation ==

Royal jelly is secreted from the glands in the heads of worker bees, and is fed to all bee larvae, whether they are destined to become drones (males), workers (sterile females) or queens (fertile females). After three days, the drone and worker larvae are no longer fed with royal jelly, but queen larvae continue to be fed this special substance throughout their development. It is harvested by humans by stimulating colonies with movable frame hives to produce queen bees. Royal jelly is collected from each individual queen cell ([[honeycomb]]) when the queen larvae are about four days old. It is collected from queen cells because these are the only cells in which large amounts are deposited; when royal jelly is fed to worker larvae, it is fed directly to them, and they consume it as it is produced, while the cells of queen larvae are &quot;stocked&quot; with royal jelly much faster than the larvae can consume it. Therefore, only in queen cells is the harvest of royal jelly practical.
A well-managed hive during a season of 5–6 months can produce approximately 500 g of royal jelly. Since the product is perishable, producers must have immediate access to proper cold storage (e.g., a household refrigerator or freezer) in which the royal jelly is stored until it is sold or conveyed to a collection centre. Sometimes [[honey]] or [[beeswax]] are added to the royal jelly, which is thought to aid its preservation.

== Composition ==

Royal jelly is collected and sold as a [[dietary supplement]] for humans, claiming various health benefits because of components such as [[B vitamins|B-complex]] [[vitamin]]s such as [[pantothenic acid]] (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] (pyridoxine). The overall composition of royal jelly is 67% [[water]], 12.5% crude [[protein]], including small amounts of many different [[amino acid]]s, and 11% simple [[sugar]]s ([[monosaccharide]]s), also including a relatively high amount (5%) of [[fatty acid]]s. It also contains many trace [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], some [[enzyme]]s, antibacterial and antibiotic components, and trace amounts of [[vitamin C]],&lt;ref name = Graham/&gt; but none of the fat-soluble vitamins, [[retinol|A]], [[vitamin d|D]], [[tocopherol|E]] and [[vitamin K|K]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urlValue-added products from beekeeping.

===Royalactin===
The component of royal jelly that causes a bee to develop into a queen appears to be a single protein that has been called royalactin. Jelly which had been rendered inactive by prolonged storage had a fresh addition of each of the components subject to decay and was fed to bees; only jelly laced with royalactin caused the larvae to become queens.&lt;ref name=royalactin&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1038/nature10093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royalactin also induces similar phenotypical change in the fruitfly ([[Drosophila melanogaster]]), marked by increased body size and ovary development.

== Epigenetic effects ==

The honey bee queens and workers represent one of the most striking examples of environmentally controlled [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]. In spite of their identical clonal nature at the DNA level, they are strongly differentiated across a wide range of characteristics including anatomical and physiological differences, longevity of the queen, and reproductive capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Winston, M, The Biology of the Honey Bee, 1987, Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Queens constitute the sexual caste and have large active ovaries, whereas workers have only rudimental inactive ovaries and are functionally sterile.  The queen/worker developmental divide is controlled [[epigenetics|epigenetically]] by differential feeding with royal jelly; this appears to be due specifically to the protein [[#Royalactin|royalactin]]. A female larva destined to become a queen is fed large quantities of royal jelly; this triggers a cascade of molecular events resulting in development into a queen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maleszka, R 2008&quot;/&gt;  It has been shown that this phenomenon is mediated by an epigenetic modification of DNA known as [[Epigenetics#DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling|CpG methylation]].&lt;ref&gt;Kucharski R, Maleszka, J, Foret, S, Maleszka, R, Nutritional Control of Reproductive Status in Honeybees via DNA Methylation. Science. 2008 Mar 28;319(5871):1827-3&lt;/ref&gt; Silencing the expression of an enzyme that methylates DNA in newly hatched larvae led to a royal jelly-like effect on the larval developmental trajectory; the majority of individuals with reduced DNA methylation levels emerged as queens with fully developed ovaries. This finding suggests that [[DNA methylation]] in honey bees allows the expression of epigenetic information to be differentially altered by nutritional input.

There are also some preliminary experiments (on cells and lab animals) in which royal jelly may have some benefit regarding certain other diseases, though there is no solid evidence for those claims, and further experimentation and validation would be needed to prove any useful benefit. 

In holistic healing circles and popular alternative medicine folklore, royal jelly is believed to have anti aging properties stemming primarily from its amino acid content and broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals. Its reputation for providing fertility and libido assistance is also gaining traction within the holistic community, though little or no clinical research exists to support these assertions.&lt;ref&gt;Benefits of Royal Jelly, ''Royal Jelly''. [http://thenaturalshopper.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=112 available online]&lt;/ref&gt; Royal jelly is also widely used as a component in skin care and natural beauty products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35136">'''Lamarckism''' (or '''Lamarckian inheritance''') is the [[idea]] that an [[organism]] can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its [[offspring]] (also known as [[inheritance of acquired characters|heritability of acquired characteristics]] or [[soft inheritance]]). It is named after the French biologist [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829), who incorporated the action of soft inheritance into his evolutionary theories. He  is often incorrectly cited{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} as the founder of soft inheritance, which proposes that individual efforts during the lifetime of the organisms were the main mechanism driving species to [[adaptation]], as they supposedly would acquire adaptive changes and pass them on to offspring.
{{Evolution theories}}
After publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]], the importance of individual efforts in the generation of adaptation was considerably diminished {{dubious|date=December 2011}}. Later, [[Mendelian genetics]] supplanted the notion of inheritance of acquired traits, eventually leading to the development of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]], and the general abandonment of the Lamarckian theory of evolution in biology. Despite this abandonment, interest in Lamarckism has recently increased, as several studies in the field of [[epigenetics]] have highlighted the possible inheritance of behavioral traits acquired by the previous generation. In a wider context, soft inheritance is of use when examining the evolution of cultures and ideas, and is related to the theory of [[memetics]].

==History==
[[Image:Jean-baptiste lamarck2.jpg|right|thumb|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]
Between 1794 and 1796 [[Erasmus Darwin]] wrote ''[[Zoonomia]]'' suggesting &quot;that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament... with the power of acquiring new parts&quot; in response to stimuli, with each round of &quot;improvements&quot; being inherited by successive generations. Subsequently [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] repeated in his ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' of 1809 the folk wisdom that characteristics which were &quot;needed&quot; were acquired (or diminished) during the lifetime of an organism then passed on to the offspring. He incorporated this mechanism into his thoughts on evolution, seeing it as resulting in the adaptation of life to local environments.

Lamarck founded a school of French ''Transformationism'' which included [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], and which corresponded with a radical British school of anatomy based in the extramural anatomy schools in [[Edinburgh]] which included the surgeon [[Robert Knox]] and the [[comparative anatomist]] [[Robert Edmund Grant]]. In addition, the Regius Professor of Natural History, [[Robert Jameson]], was the probable author of an anonymous paper in 1826 praising &quot;Mr. Lamarck&quot; for explaining how the higher animals had &quot;evolved&quot; from the &quot;simplest worms&quot; – this was the first use of the word &quot;evolved&quot; in a modern sense. [[Charles Darwin's education|As a young student]], [[Charles Darwin]] was tutored by Grant, and worked with him on marine creatures.

The ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', authored by [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]] in [[St Andrews]] and published anonymously in England in 1844, proposed a theory which combined radical phrenology with Lamarckism, causing political controversy for its [[Extremism|radicalism]] and unorthodoxy, but exciting popular interest and preparing a huge and prosperous audience for Darwin.

Darwin's ''[[Origin of Species]]'' proposed [[natural selection]] as the main mechanism for development of species, but did not rule out a variant of Lamarckism as a supplementary mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Desmond|Desmond A.]] &amp; [[James Moore (biographer)|Moore, J.]] (1991) ''Darwin'' Penguin Books p.617 &quot;Darwin was {{sic|?|loathe|reason=The adjective is &quot;loth&quot;}} to let go of the notion that a well-used and strengthened organ could be inherited&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin called his Lamarckian hypothesis [[Pangenesis]], and explained it in the final chapter of his book ''Variation in Plants and Animals under Domestication'', after describing numerous examples to demonstrate what he considered to be the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Pangenesis, which he emphasised was a hypothesis, was based on the idea that [[somatic cell]]s would, in response to environmental stimulation (use and disuse), throw off '[[gemmules]]' or 'pangenes' which travelled around the body (though not necessarily in the bloodstream). These pangenes were microscopic particles that supposedly contained information about the characteristics of their parent cell, and Darwin believed that they eventually accumulated in the germ cells where they could pass on to the next generation the newly acquired characteristics of the parents. Darwin's half-cousin, [[Francis Galton]] carried out experiments on rabbits, with Darwin's cooperation, in which he transfused the blood of one variety of rabbit into another variety in the expectation that its offspring would show some characteristics of the first. They did not, and Galton declared that he had disproved Darwin's hypothesis of Pangenesis, but Darwin objected, in a letter to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', that he had done nothing of the sort, since he had never mentioned blood in his writings. He pointed out that he regarded Pangenesis as occurring in Protozoa and plants, which have no blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1751&amp;pageseq=1 |title=Pangenesis |accessdate=2007-11-08 |author= Charles Darwin|authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=27 April 1871 |work= |publisher=''Nature''. A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Science |pages=502–503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1880 to 1930===
The period of the [[history of evolutionary thought]] between Darwin's death in the 1880s and the foundation of [[population genetics]] in the 1920s, and the beginnings of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] in the 1930s is sometimes called [[the eclipse of Darwinism]] by some historians of science, because during that time many scientists and philosophers accepted the reality of evolution but doubted whether [[natural selection]] was the main evolutionary mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quammen|first=David|authorlink=David Quammen|title=The Reluctant Mr. Darwin|publisher=Atlas Books|year=2006|isbn=0-393-05981-2|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories involving the inheritance of acquired characteristics were among the most popular alternatives to natural selection, and scientists who felt that such Lamarckian mechanisms were the key to evolution were called neo-Lamarckians. Proponents included the British botanist [[George Henslow]] who studied the effects of environmental stress on the growth of plants in the belief that such environmentally induced variation might explain much of plant evolution, and the American entomologist [[Alpheus S. Packard|Alpheus Packard]] who studied blind animals living in caves and wrote a book in 1901 about Lamarck and his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowler236_244&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|authorlink=Peter J. Bowler|title=Evolution:The History of an Idea|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=0-52023693-9|pages=236–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quammen|first=David|authorlink=David Quammen|title=The Reluctant Mr. Darwin|publisher=Atlas Books|year=2006|isbn=0-393-05981-2|pages=218, 220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also included were a number of paleontologists like [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]] who felt that the fossil record showed orderly, almost linear, patterns of development that they felt were better explained by Lamarckian mechanisms than by natural selection. Some people including Cope and Darwin critic [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] felt that inheritance of acquired characteristics would let organisms shape their own evolution, since organisms that acquired new habits would change the use patterns of their organs, which would kick-start Lamarckian evolution. They considered this philosophically superior to Darwin's mechanism of random variation acted on by selective pressures. Lamarckism also appealed to those, like the philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]] and the German anatomist [[Ernst Haeckel]], who saw evolution as an inherently progressive process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowler236_244&quot;/&gt; The German zoologist [[Theodor Eimer]] combined Larmarckism with ideas about [[orthogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Quammen|first=David|authorlink=David Quammen|title=The Reluctant Mr. Darwin|publisher=Atlas Books|year=2006|isbn=0-393-05981-2|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of the modern synthesis of the [[evolution|theory of evolution]] and a lack of evidence for either a mechanism or even the heritability of acquired characteristics, Lamarckism largely fell from favor.

In the 1920s, experiments by [[Paul Kammerer]] on [[amphibian]]s, particularly the [[midwife toad]], appeared to find evidence supporting Lamarckism, but his specimens with supposedly acquired black foot-pads were found to have been tampered with. In ''The Case of the Midwife Toad'' [[Arthur Koestler]] surmised that the tampering had been done by a [[Nazi]] sympathiser to discredit Kammerer for his political views, and that his research might actually have been valid. However most biologists believe that Kammerer was a fraud and even among those who believe he was not dishonest most believe that he misinterpreted the results of his experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|authorlink=Peter J. Bowler|title=Evolution:The History of an Idea|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=0-52023693-9|pages=245–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 1930===
A form of Lamarckism was revived in the [[Soviet Union]] of the 1930s when [[Trofim Lysenko]] promoted [[Lysenkoism]] which suited the ideological opposition of [[Joseph Stalin]] to [[genetics]]. This ideologically driven research influenced Soviet agricultural policy which in turn was later blamed for crop failures.

Since 1988 certain scientists have produced work proposing that Lamarckism could apply to single celled organisms. A version of Lamarckian acquisition in higher order animals is still posited in certain branches of [[psychology]], as, for example, in the Jungian [[racial memory]].

Neo-Lamarckism is a theory of inheritance based on a modification and extension of Lamarckism, essentially maintaining the principle that genetic changes can be influenced and directed by environmental factors.

==Lamarck's theory==
[[Image:Giraffes, Pengo.jpg|thumb|The evolution of necks is often used as the example in explanations of Lamarckism.]]
The identification of Lamarckism with the inheritance of acquired characteristics is regarded by some as an artifact of the subsequent history of evolutionary thought, repeated in textbooks without analysis. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] wrote that late 19th century evolutionists &quot;''re-read Lamarck, cast aside the guts of it ... and elevated one aspect of the mechanics - inheritance of acquired characters - to a central focus it never had for Lamarck himself''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen J. &quot;Shades of Lamarck&quot;, reprinted in ''The Panda's Thumb'' (1980) pp.65-71. Quote from page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that &quot;''the restriction of &quot;Lamarckism&quot; to this relatively small and non-distinctive corner of Lamarck's thought must be labelled as more than a misnomer, and truly a discredit to the memory of a man and his much more comprehensive system''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Stephen J. |title= [[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]|year= 2002 |publisher= Belknap Harvard |location=Harvard|isbn= 0-674-00613-5 | pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould advocated defining &quot;Lamarckism&quot; more broadly, in line with Lamarck's overall evolutionary theory.

Lamarck incorporated two ideas into his theory of evolution, in his day considered to be generally true:

# Use and disuse &amp;ndash; Individuals lose characteristics they do not require (or use) and develop characteristics that are useful.
# Inheritance of acquired traits &amp;ndash; Individuals inherit the traits of their ancestors.

Examples of what is traditionally called &quot;Lamarckism&quot; would include:
* [[Giraffe]]s stretching their necks to reach leaves high in trees (especially [[Acacia]]s), strengthen and gradually lengthen their necks. These giraffes have offspring with slightly longer necks (also known as &quot;soft inheritance&quot;).
* A [[blacksmith]], through his work, strengthens the muscles in his arms. His sons will have similar muscular development when they mature.

With this in mind, Lamarck has been credited in some textbooks{{Which?|date=August 2010}} and popular culture{{Which?|date=August 2010}} with developing two laws:
# ''In every animal which has not passed the limit of its development, a more frequent and continuous use of any organ gradually strengthens, develops and enlarges that organ, and gives it a power proportional to the length of time it has been so used; while the permanent disuse of any organ imperceptibly weakens and deteriorates it, and progressively diminishes its functional capacity, until it finally disappears.''
# ''All the acquisitions or losses wrought by nature on individuals, through the influence of the environment in which their race has long been placed, and hence through the influence of the predominant use or permanent disuse of any organ; all these are preserved by reproduction to the new individuals which arise, provided that the acquired modifications are common to both sexes, or at least to the individuals which produce the young.''&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Baptiste Lamarck ''Zoological Philosophy'' trans. Hugh Elliot, U. Chicago Press, 1984, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, a change in the environment brings about change in &quot;needs&quot; (''besoins''), resulting in change in behavior, bringing change in organ usage and development, bringing change in form over time &amp;mdash; and thus the gradual [[Transmutation of species|transmutation]] of the [[species]].

However, as historians of science such as [[Michael Ghiselin]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] have pointed out, none of these views were original to Lamarck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm The Imaginary Lamarck: a look at bogus &quot;history&quot; in schoolbooks] by [[Michael Ghiselin]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S.J. (2002) ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory''&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, Lamarck's contribution was a systematic theoretical framework for understanding evolution. He saw evolution as comprising two processes;

# ''Le pouvoir de la vie (a complexifying force)'' - in which the natural, alchemical movements of fluids would etch out organs from tissues, leading to ever more complex construction regardless of the organ's use or disuse. This would drive organisms from simple to complex forms.
# ''L'influence des circonstances (an adaptive force)'' - in which the use and disuse of characters led organisms to become more adapted to their environment. This would take organisms sideways off the path from simple to complex, specialising them for their environment.

== Current views ==

Interest in Lamarckism has recently increased, as several studies in the field of [[epigenetics]] have highlighted the possible inheritance of behavioral traits acquired by the previous generation. A recent such study examined foraging behavior in chickens as a function of stress,&lt;ref name=&quot;plosone.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0006405 |title=Inheritance of Acquired Behaviour Adaptations and Brain Gene Expression in Chickens |publisher=Plos One |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  concluding:&lt;blockquote&gt;Our findings suggest that unpredictable food access caused seemingly adaptive responses in feeding behavior, which may have been transmitted to the offspring by means of epigenetic mechanisms, including regulation of immune genes. This may have prepared the offspring for coping with an unpredictable environment.... Transmissions of information across generations which does not involve traditional inheritance of DNA-sequence alleles is often referred to as soft inheritance &lt;ref&gt;Richards EJ (2006) Inherited epigenetic variation–revisiting soft inheritance. Nat Rev Genet 7(5): 395–401.&lt;/ref&gt; or 'Lamarckian inheritance'.&lt;ref name=&quot;plosone.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The evolution of acquired characteristics has also been shown in human populations who have experienced starvation, resulting in altered gene function in both the starved population and their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=3596539 |title=Timing of prenatal starvation in women and birth weight in their first and second born offspring : the Dutch famine birth cohort study |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process of [[DNA methylation]] is thought to be behind such changes.

In October 2010, further evidence linking food intake to traits inherited by the offspring were shown in a study of rats conducted by several Australian universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Post a free job |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7318/full/nature09491.html |title=Chronic high-fat diet in fathers programs [bgr&amp;#93;-cell dysfunction in female rat offspring : Nature : Nature Publishing Group |publisher=Nature |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study strongly suggested that fathers can transfer a propensity for obesity to their daughters as a result of the fathers' food intake, '''and not their genetics''' (or specific genes), prior to the conception of the daughter. A &quot;paternal high-fat diet&quot; was shown to cause cell dysfunction in the daughter, which in turn led to obesity for the daughter.

Several historians have argued that Lamarck's name is linked somewhat unfairly to the theory that has come to bear his name, and that Lamarck deserves credit for being an influential early proponent of the ''concept'' of biological evolution, far more than for the ''mechanism'' of evolution, in which he simply followed the accepted wisdom of his time. Lamarck died 30 years before the first publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''Origin of Species''. According to [[Stephen Jay Gould]], if Lamarck had been aware of Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection, there is no reason to assume he would not have accepted it as a more likely alternative to his own mechanism. Note also that Darwin, like Lamarck, lacked a plausible alternative mechanism of inheritance - the [[Particulate inheritance theory|particulate nature of inheritance]] was only observed by [[Gregor Mendel]] somewhat later, and published in 1866. Its full significance was not appreciated until the [[Modern evolutionary synthesis]] in the early 1920s. An important point in its favour at the time was that Lamarck's theory contained a mechanism describing how variation is maintained, which Darwin’s own theory lacked.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Several recent studies, one conducted by researchers at MIT and another by researchers at the Tufts University School of Medicine, have rekindled the debate once again. As [http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/22061 reported] in MIT's Technology Review in February 2009, &quot;The effects of an animal's environment during adolescence can be passed down to future offspring ... The findings provide support for a 200-year-old theory of evolution that has been largely dismissed: Lamarckian evolution, which states that acquired characteristics can be passed on to offspring.&quot;

A report investigating the inheritance of resistance to viral infection in the [[nematode]] ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' suggests that small RNA molecules may be inherited in a non Mendelian fashion and provide resistance to infection.&lt;ref name=Rechavi2011&gt;Rechavi O, Minevich G, Hobert O (2011) Transgenerational inheritance of an acquired small RNA-Based antiviral response in ''C. elegans''. Cell 147(6):1248-1256&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neo-Lamarckism ==

Unlike [[neo-Darwinism]], the term neo-Lamarckism refers more to a loose grouping of largely heterodox theories and mechanisms that emerged after Lamarck's time, than to any coherent body of theoretical work.

In the 1920s, Harvard University researcher [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] studied the abilities of rats to correctly solve mazes. He found that offspring of rats that had learned the maze were able to run it faster. The first rats would get it wrong 165 times before being able to run it perfectly each time, but after a few generations it was down to 20. McDougall attributed this to some sort of Lamarckian evolutionary process.&lt;ref&gt;
McDougall, 1938. British Journal of Psychology 28:321-345&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Oscar Werner Tiegs]] and [[Wilfred Eade Agar]] later showed McDougall's results to be incorrect, caused by poor experimental controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pantin, C F A |publisher=[[The Royal Society]] |journal=Biographical Memiors of Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] |volume=3 |date=November 1957 |page=247 |title=Oscar Werner Tiegs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=First report on a test of McDougall's Lamarckian experiment on the training of rats |year=1935 |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=12 |page=191 |author=W E Agar, F H Drummond}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Second report on a test of McDougall's Lamarckian experiment on the training of rats |year=1942 |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=19 |page=158 |author=W E Agar, F H Drummond}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Third report on a test of McDougall's Lamarckian experiment on the training of rats |year=1948 |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=25 |page=103 |author=W E Agar, F H Drummond}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fourth (final) report on a test of McDougall's Lamarckian experiment on the training of rats |year=1954 |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=31 |page=308 |author=W E Agar, F H Drummond, M M Gunson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At around the same time, [[Ivan Pavlov]], who was also a Lamarckist, claimed to have observed a similar phenomenon in animals being subject to [[conditioned reflex]] experiments. He claimed that with each generation, the animals became easier to condition. However, Pavlov never suggested a mechanism to explain these observations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[Peter Bowler]] wrote that [[Edward Drinker Cope]] was a neo-Lamarckian as he believed it allowed living things to be in charge of their own destiny as opposed to the Darwinian view of living things being a puppet at the mercy of the environment. Cope's neo-Lamarckism had claimed that the organism could respond to any challenge by choosing to adapt to a new way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Bowler ''Evolution: the history of an idea'' 1989 p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The neo-Lamarckian version of evolution was more popular than Darwin's in the late 19th century as it made it possible for biological evolution to fit into a framework of a divine or natural directed plan, thus the neo-Lamarckian view of evolution was often advocated by proponents of [[orthogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bowler ''The eclipse of Darwinism: anti-Darwinian evolution theories in the decades around 1990'' 1992&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 20th century [[Frederic Wood Jones]] and [[Robert Broom]] had supported a neo-Lamarckian view of human evolution as opposed to the Darwinian view. Neo-Lamarckism often argued for [[parallel evolution]] and independent evolution of species. [[Hermann Klaatsch]] had relied on a neo-Lamarckian model of evolution to try and explain the origin of [[bipedalism]]. Klaatsch's model had claimed that human races had evolved independent of each other and because of this his model had influenced the belief of [[polygenism]]. Neo-Lamarckism remained influential in [[biology]] until the 1940s when the role of [[natural selection]] was reasserted in evolution as part of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard A. Wood ''Wiley-Blackwell encyclopedia of human evolution'' 2011, Blackwell Publishing Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;   

Later supporters of Neo-Lamarckism were [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Arthur Koestler]] who both claimed Lamarckism is more humane, and optimistic than Darwinism.&lt;ref&gt;James Richard Moore, History, Humanity and Evolution: Essays for John C. Greene, 1992, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soma to germ-line feedback'''

In the 1970s the immunologist [[Edward J. Steele|Ted Steele]], formerly of the [[University of Wollongong]], and colleagues, proposed a neo-Lamarckian mechanism to try to explain why homologous DNA sequences from the VDJ gene regions of parent mice were found in their germ cells and seemed to persist in the offspring for a few generations. The mechanism involved the somatic selection and clonal amplification of newly acquired [[antibody]] gene sequences that were generated via somatic hyper-mutation in [[B-cells]]. The mRNA products of these somatically novel genes were captured by retroviruses endogenous to the B-cells and were then transported through the blood stream where they could breach the [[Weismann barrier|soma-germ barrier]] and retrofect ([[reverse transcription|reverse transcribe]]) the newly acquired genes into the cells of the germ line. Although Steele was advocating this theory for the better part of two decades, little more than indirect evidence was ever acquired to support it. An interesting attribute of this idea is that it strongly resembles Darwin's own theory of pangenesis, except in the soma to germ line feedback theory, pangenes are replaced with realistic retroviruses.&lt;ref name=Steele&gt;''Lamarck's Signature: how retrogenes are changing Darwin's natural selection paradigm''. Edward J. Steele, Robyn A. Lindley, Robert V. Blanden. Perseus Books, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epigenetic inheritance'''

Forms of 'soft' or [[epigenetic inheritance]] within organisms have been suggested as neo-Lamarckian in nature by such scientists as [[Eva Jablonka]] and [[Marion J. Lamb]]. In addition to 'hard' or genetic inheritance, involving the duplication of genetic material and its segregation during [[meiosis]], there are other hereditary elements that pass into the germ cells also. These include things like [[DNA methylation|methylation]] patterns in DNA and [[chromatin]] marks, both of which regulate the activity of genes. These are considered &quot;Lamarckian&quot; in the sense that they are responsive to environmental stimuli and can differentially affect gene expression adaptively, with phenotypic results that can persist for many generations in certain organisms. Although the reality of epigenetic inheritance is not doubted (as many experiments have validated it), its significance to the evolutionary process is uncertain. Most neo-Darwinians consider{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} epigenetic inheritance mechanisms to be little more than a specialized form of [[phenotypic plasticity]], with no potential to introduce evolutionary novelty into a species lineage.&lt;ref name=Jablonka&gt;''Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution: The Lamarckian Dimension''. Eva Jablonka, Marion J. Lamb. Oxford University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lamarckism and single-celled organisms==
While Lamarckism has been discredited as an evolutionary influence for larger lifeforms, some scientists controversially argue that it can be observed among [[microorganisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Adaptive mutation ''Genetics'', Vol. 148, April 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Whether such mutations are directed or not also remains in contention. (see [[Horizontal Gene Transfer]])

In 1988, [[John Cairns (biochemist)|John Cairns]] at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]] in [[Oxford]], [[England]], and a group of other scientists renewed the Lamarckian controversy (which at that point had been a dead debate for many years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mun.ca/biochem/courses/4103/topics/adaptive_mutation.html |title=Adaptive mutation in bacteria |publisher=Mun.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group took a mutated strain of ''[[E. coli]]'' that was unable to consume the sugar [[lactose]] and placed it in an environment where lactose was the only food source. They observed over time that mutations occurred within the colony at a rate that suggested the bacteria were overcoming their handicap by altering their own genes. Cairns, among others, dubbed the process [[adaptive mutation]].

If bacteria that had overcome their own inability to consume lactose passed on this &quot;learned&quot; trait to future generations, it could be argued as a form of Lamarckism; though Cairns later chose to distance himself from such a position.&lt;ref&gt;Adaptive mutation in [[E. coli]], ''Journal of Bacteriology'', August 2004, Vol. 186, No. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  More typically, it might be viewed as a form of [[Baldwinian evolution|ontogenic evolution]].

There has been some research into Lamarckism and [[prion]]s. A group of researchers, for example, discovered that in [[Yeast|yeast cells]] containing a specific prion protein Sup35, the yeast were able to gain new [[genetic material]], some of which gave them new abilities such as [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to a particular [[herbicide]]. When the researchers crossed the yeast cells with cells not containing the prion, the trait reappeared in some of the resulting [[offspring]], indicating that some information indeed was passed down, though whether or not the information is genetic is debatable: trace prion amounts in the cells may be passed to their offspring, giving the appearance of a new genetic trait where there is none.&lt;ref&gt;Lamarckism and prions, ''New Scientist'', 21 August 2004, Issue #2461&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there is growing evidence that cells can activate low-fidelity [[DNA polymerase]]s in times of stress to induce mutations. While this does not directly confer advantage to the organism on the organismal level, it makes sense at the gene-evolution level. While the acquisition of new genetic traits is random, and selection remains Darwinian, the active process of identifying the necessity to mutate is considered to be Lamarckian.

==Lamarckism and societal change==
[[Jean Molino]] (2000) has proposed that Lamarckian evolution may be accurately applied to [[cultural evolution]]. This was also previously suggested by [[Peter Medawar]] (1959) and [[Conrad Waddington]] (1961). K. N. Laland and colleagues have recently suggested that human culture can be looked upon as an [[ecological niche]] like phenomena, where the effects of cultural [[niche construction]] are transmissible from one generation to the next. One interpretation of the [[Meme]] theory is that memes are both Darwinian and Lamarckian in nature, as in addition to being subject to selection pressures based on their ability to differentially influence Human minds, memes can be modified and the effects of that modification passed on. [[Richard Dawkins]] notes (in Blackmore 2000: The Meme machine, page 13), that Memes can be copied in a Lamarckian way (copying of the product) or in a [[August Weismann|Weismann]]-type evolutionary way (copying of the instruction) which is much more resistant against changes.

'''Paul Kammerer''' (17 August 1880, in [[Vienna]] – 23 September 1926, in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg]]) was an [[Austria]]n biologist who studied and advocated the now abandoned [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian theory of inheritance]] – the notion that organisms may pass to their offspring characteristics they have acquired in their lifetime. He began his academic career at the [[Vienna Academy]] studying music but graduated with a degree in [[biology]].

==Work==
Kammerer undertook numerous biology experiments, largely involving interfering with the breeding and [[embryology|development]] of [[amphibians]]. He coerced [[ovoviviparous]] [[fire salamander]]s to become [[viviparous]], and viviparous [[alpine salamander]]s to become ovoviviparous. In lesser-known experiments, he manipulated and bred [[olm]]s. He made olms produce live young, and he bred dark-colored olms with full vision. He supported the [[Lamarckian]] theory of the heritability of acquired characteristics, and experimented extensively to prove this theory.&lt;ref name=Schmuck&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schmuck |first=Thomas |title=The Midwife Toad and Human Progress |editor-last=Hofrichter |editor-first=Robert |encyclopedia = Amphibians: The World of Frogs, Toads, Salamanders and Newts |pages=212–213 |publisher=Firefly |location=New York |isbn=1-55209-541-X |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kammerer succeeded in making [[midwife toad]]s breed in the water by increasing water temperatures, and reported that his midwife toads were exhibiting black [[nuptial pad]]s on their feet. While the prehistoric ancestors of midwife toads had these pads, Kammerer considered this an acquired characteristic brought about by adaptation to environment.&lt;ref name=Schmuck/&gt; Claims arose that the result of the experiment had been falsified. The most notable of these claims was made by [[Gladwyn Kingsley Noble|Dr. G. K. Noble]], Curator of Reptiles at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. Noble claimed that the black pads actually had a far more mundane explanation: it had simply been injected there with Indian ink.&lt;ref&gt;''Nature'', 7 August 1926&lt;/ref&gt; Six weeks later, Kammerer committed suicide in the forest of [[Schneeberg (Alps)|Schneeberg]].&lt;ref name=Schmuck/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Interest in Kammerer revived in 1971 with the publication of [[Arthur Koestler]]'s book, ''The Case of the Midwife Toad''. Koestler surmised that Kammerer's experiments on the midwife toad may have been tampered with by a [[Nazism|Nazi sympathizer]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. Certainly, as Koestler writes, &quot;the ''Hakenkreuzler'', the swastika-wearers, as the Austrian Nazis of the early days were called, were growing in power. One center of ferment was the University of Vienna&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univie.ac.at/archiv/tour/19.htm University 1938-1945]&lt;/ref&gt; where, on the traditional Saturday morning student parades, bloody battles were fought. Kammerer was known by his public lectures and newspaper articles as an ardent pacifist and Socialist; it was also known that he was going to build an institute in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]]. &quot;An act of sabotage in the laboratory would have been…in keeping with the climate of those days.&quot;

Kammerer had previously exhibited the toad in England, where it had been inspected by eminent zoologists, all of whom doubted the validity of [[Lamarckism]], and none of them detected the irregularities later discovered by Noble.  Since the injected ink was rather conspicuous, this suggests that the possible sabotage had been committed shortly before Noble's visit to Vienna, when Kammerer was no longer working at the Institute.

Kammerer had already experimented with sea squirts, salamanders and other animals and believed that these experiments provided evidence of Lamarckian inheritance. He regarded the possible inheritance of a pad on the foot of a male midwife toad as of relatively minor significance in the argument. Many biologists from all over Europe visited him in Vienna and photographs and reports of his work were widely available. He approved the inspection of the specimen which was found to have been tampered with and expressed great astonishment when this was made known to him.

As a consequence of Noble's refutation, interest in Lamarckian inheritance diminished except in the Soviet Union where it was championed by [[Trofim Lysenko|Lysenko]]. The contemporary view in biology remained that acquired characteristics cannot be inherited and that every case documented by Kammerer falls in the broad category of [[phenotypic plasticity]].

Sander Gliboff of the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, [[Indiana University]] has commented that, though Kammerer's conclusions proved false, his evidence was probably genuine and that he did not simply argue for Lamarckism and against Darwinism as those theories are now understood. Rather, if we look beyond the scandal, the story shows us much about the competing theories of biological and cultural evolution and the range of new ideas about heredity and variation in early 20th-century biology and the changes in experimental approach that have occurred since that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Sander|last=Gliboff|title=&quot;Protoplasm…is soft wax in our hands&quot;: Paul Kammerer and the art of biological transformation|journal=Endeavour|volume=29|issue=4|pages=162–167|year=2005|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2005.10.001|pmid=16271762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Alexander Vargas, an evolutionary developmental biologist, suggested that the inheritance of acquired traits (Lamarckian inheritance) that Kammerer observed in the Midwife Toad could be real and could be explained by [[epigenetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Elizabeth|last=Pennisi|date=4 September 2009|title=The Case of the Midwife Toad: Fraud or Epigenetics?|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5945|pages=1194–1195|doi=10.1126/science.325_1194|pmid=19729631}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kammerer could be the true discoverer of non-[[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]], epigenetic inheritance. The mechanism of epigenetic inheritance is a chemical modification of DNA (e.g. [[DNA methylation]]) that can be passed on to subsequent generations. Furthermore, the [[parent-of-origin effect]], which was confusing at the time, can be explained today because similar effects have been discovered in other organisms.

==Seriality theory==
Kammerer's other passion was collecting coincidences. He published a book with the title ''Das Gesetz der Serie'' (''The Law of the Series''; never translated into English) in which he recounted some 100 anecdotes of coincidences that had led him to formulate his theory of Seriality.

He postulated that all events are connected by waves of seriality. These unknown forces would cause what we would perceive as just the peaks, or groupings and coincidences. Kammerer was known to, for example, make notes in public parks of what numbers of people were passing by, how many carried umbrellas etc. [[Albert Einstein]] called the idea of Seriality &quot;interesting, and by no means absurd&quot;, while [[Carl Jung]] drew upon Kammerer's work in his essay ''Synchronicity''. Koestler reported that, when researching for his biography about Kammerer, he himself was subjected to &quot;a meteor shower&quot; of coincidences - as if Kammerer's ghost were grinning down at him saying, &quot;I told you so!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Koestler, ''The Roots of Coincidence'', 1972, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Histone H3''' is one of the five main [[histone]] [[protein]]s involved in the structure of [[chromatin]] in  [[eukaryotic cell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Featuring a main globular domain and a long [[N-terminal end|N-terminal tail]], H3 is involved with the structure of the [[nucleosome]]s of the 'beads on a string' structure. Histone proteins are highly post-translationally modified however Histone H3 is the most extensively modified of the five histones. The term &quot;Histone H3&quot; alone is purposely ambiguous in that it does not distinguish between sequence variants or modification state. Histone H3 is an important protein in the emerging field of [[epigenetics]], where its sequence variants and variable modification states are thought to play a role in the dynamic and long term regulation of genes.

==Epigenetics and Post-Translational Modifications==

The N-terminal tail of histone H3 protrudes from the globular [[nucleosome]] core and can undergo several different types of post-translational modification that influence cellular processes.  These modifications include the covalent attachment of methyl or acetyl groups to [[lysine]] and [[arginine]] amino acids and the phosphorylation of [[serine]] or [[threonine]].  Di- and Tri-methylation of Lysine 9 are associated with repression and heterochromatin, while mono-methylation of K9 is associated with active genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenfeld_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rosenfeld JA, Wang Z, Schones DE, Zhao K, DeSalle R, Zhang MQ | title = Determination of enriched histone modifications in non-genic portions of the human genome | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 10| pages = 143 | year = 2009 | month = March | pmid = 19335899 | pmc = 2667539 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-10-143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  has been associated with [[gene silencing]] and the formation of relatively inactive regions of DNA known as [[heterochromatin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11242053&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lachner M, O'Carroll D, Rea S, Mechtler K, Jenuwein T | title = Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 creates a binding site for HP1 proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 410 | issue = 6824 | pages = 116–20 | year = 2001 | month = March | pmid = 11242053 | doi = 10.1038/35065132 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acetylation of histone H3 occurs at several different lysine positions in the histone tail and is performed by a family of enzymes known as [[histone acetyltransferase]]s (HATs).  Acetylation of lysine14 is commonly seen in genes that are being actively transcribed into [[RNA]].

==Sequence Variants==
Mammalian cells have three known sequence variants of histone H3. These are denoted as Histone H3.1, Histone H3.2 and Histone H3.3 but are highly sequence conserved differing only by a few amino acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12408966&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marzluff WF, Gongidi P, Woods KR, Jin J, Maltais LJ | title = The human and mouse replication-dependent histone genes | journal = Genomics | volume = 80 | issue = 5 | pages = 487–98 | year = 2002 | month = November | pmid = 12408966 | doi = 10.1016/S0888-7543(02)96850-3 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16267050&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hake SB, Garcia BA, Duncan EM, Kauer M, Dellaire G, Shabanowitz J, Bazett-Jones DP, Allis CD, Hunt DF | title = Expression patterns and post-translational modifications associated with mammalian histone H3 variants | journal = J.

==Genetics==

Histone H3s are coded by several genes in the human genome, including:

* H3.1: [[HIST1H3A]], [[HIST1H3B]], [[HIST1H3C]], [[HIST1H3D]], [[HIST1H3E]], [[HIST1H3F]], [[HIST1H3G]], [[HIST1H3H]], [[HIST1H3I]], [[HIST1H3J]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7437">In [[epigenetics]], '''paramutation''' is an interaction between two [[alleles]] of a single [[locus (genetics)|locus]], resulting in a heritable change of one allele that is induced by the other allele. Paramutation violates Mendel’s first law, which states  that in the process of the formation of the gametes (egg or sperm) the allelic pairs separate, one going to each gamete, and that each allele remains completely uninfluenced by the other. In paramutation an allele in one generation heritably affects the other allele in future generations, even if the allele causing the change is itself not transmitted. What may be transmitted are patterns of [[DNA methylation]] or RNAs such as [[piRNA]]s, [[siRNA]]s, [[miRNA]]s or other regulatory [[RNA]]s. Through proper breeding, paramutation can result in [[genome|isogenic]] sibling plants with drastically different [[phenotype]]s.

Paramutation was first discovered and studied in [[maize]] (''Zea mays'') by [[Royal Alexander Brink|R.A. Brink]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in the 1950s. Brink noticed that specific weakly expressed alleles of the ''red1'' ''(r1)'' locus in maize, which encodes a [[transcription factor]] that confers red pigment to [[corn kernels]], can heritably change specific strongly expressed alleles to a weaker expression state. The weaker expression state adopted by the changed allele is heritable and can, in turn, change the expression state of other active alleles in a process termed '''secondary paramutation'''. Brink showed that the influence of the paramutagenic allele could persist for many generations.

Interestingly, paramutation can result in a single allele of a gene controlling a spectrum of phenotypes. At ''r1'' in maize, for example, the weaker expression state adopted by an allele following paramutation can range from completely colorless to nearly fully colored kernels. This is an exception to the general observation that [[continuous variation]] is controlled by many genes. 

Allelic interactions similar to paramutation have since been reported in other organisms, including [[tomato]], [[pea]], and [[mouse|mice]]. 

The molecular basis of paramutation is being unraveled, almost exclusively in [[maize]]. Paramutation may share common mechanisms with other [[epigenetic]] phenomena, such as [[gene silencing]] and [[genomic imprinting]]. In maize, paramutation seems to share many traits with the well understood RNA-directed DNA-methylation pathway in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'', even though it has never been observed in the famous model plant. Alleman (2006) reported that, in maize, &quot;paramutation is RNA-directed. Stability of the chromatin states associated with paramutation and transposon silencing requires the ''mop1'' gene, which encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.&quot; Exactly how the RNA produced by this polymerase causes paramutation in maize is not yet understood, but like other epigenetic changes, it involves the covalent modification of DNA and/or the DNA-bound histone proteins without changing the DNA sequence itself.

EXPLANATION

A classic example of natural TGS, called paramutation, occurs when certain combinations of alleles are present together in heterozygous conditions. Paramutation was first described in maize for the r1 (Red1) gene and later was shown to occur for two other maize genes, b1 (Booster  and pl1 (Purple plant, each of which encode transcriptional regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Paramutation produces a heritable change in the expression state of the affected allele, resulting in reduced tissue pigmentation. Paramutation of b1 and pl1 was correlated with reduced transcription of the affected genes, without any detectable changes in their primary DNA sequence. In addition to these natural paramutation phenomena in maize, certain transgene loci in petunia, tobacco, and rice are reported to interact in a manner similar to that seen in paramutation. These results indicate that trans-silencing effects resulting from homology-based interactions similar to paramutation are likely to be widespread in plant
. A violation of one of Mendelian genetics' central rules—that in a heterozygote, one allele does not alter in any way or influence the expression of the other allele—is seen in paramutation. In maize, several loci that encode regulators of the anthocyanin synthesis pathway [red1 (r1), booster1 (b1) and purple plant1 (pl1)] show paramutation interactions between their different respective alleles, Three classes of alleles occur in paramutation: paramutagenic, paramutable and neutral. In a heterozygote, paramutagenic alleles are able to convert paramutable alleles to a paramutagenic allele, which is seen as a huge drop in expression from the converted allele. Not only does this conversion persist in the heterozygote and result in highly reduced expression of the locus, but the alteration to the paramutable allele is heritable. Hence, the modified, silenced allele can be segregated away from the original paramutagenic allele, and it can then persist and behave as a paramutagenic allele itself and convert other natïve paramutable alleles. Typically, this new state is stable but it can convert back spontaneously to the naïve paramutable state Of course, this indicates that the alteration is not at the nucleotide level and indeed this has been demonstrated to be the case in paramutation. Although paramutation was originally discovered in maize, several examples of paramutation in other plants have been discovered, overlapping with transgene silencing in some cases, although it remains rare and exceptional

'''Zymo Research''' is a manufacturer of molecular biology research tools.

== History ==
Zymo Research Corporation was found by Larry Jia in 1994. The company started its home base in [[Orange, California|Orange, CA]], manufacturing products for [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] extraction and purification and other specialty products for [[E. coli]] and [[yeast]] based research. Since then, it has expanded its product offerings to include tools for [[Epigenetics]] research.
As of December 2010, the privately held company has relocated its headquartered operations to [[Irvine, California|Irvine, CA]].

== Products ==
The company is a supplier of [[DNA extraction]] and [[RNA extraction]] kit products used to isolate and purify DNA and RNA from various sample sources ranging from tough to lyse environmental samples to tissue, blood, and serum samples.&lt;ref&gt;http://bitesizebio.com/2008/01/21/dna-gel-extraction-miniprep-cleanup-kits-zymo/&lt;/ref&gt; They have expanded in recent years and today have emerged as an [[Epigenetics]] company, offering products in [[DNA methylation]] and DNA Hydroxymethylation.

=== Epigenetics Research Tools ===
Zymo Research offers from their [[Epigenetics]] line-up products for CpG methylation detection and quantitation. Many of these products exploit the [[Bisulfite sequencing|bisulfite conversion]] approach, wherein unmethylated [[cytosine]] is converted to [[uracil]], allowing for downstream sequencing analysis. The company also offers polymerases optimized for PCR analysis of bisulfite-converted DNA, as well as antibodies for IP-based [[epigenetics]] research.

In addition to their methylation portfolio, Zymo Research recently began to offer product lines for analysis of [[5-hydroxymethylcytosine]]. In late 2010, the company became the first to offer a kit for locus specific [[5-hydroxymethylcytosine]] detection (protection, digestion, amplification).

Included in the company’s epigenetics portfolio are kits for nucleosomal DNA purification, [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]], and [[small RNA]] isolation.

== Distribution ==
The company's products are distributed in North America and internationally through distributors located in Europe, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia, and others.

Jablonka publishes about [[evolution]]ary themes, especially [[epigenetics]]. Her emphasis on non-genetic forms of evolution has received interest from those attempting to expand the scope of [[evolutionist]] thinking into other spheres. An example of her work in this area is the book ''Animal Traditions'' (2000), co-authored with Eytan Avital, in which they extend models of human [[Cultural learning|cultural transmission]] to the non-human animal world, to show that [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural evolution]] has played an important role in the evolution of other animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sterelny&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title= [[Dawkins vs. Gould]]: Survival of the Fittest | author= Sterelny, K.|authorlink=Kim Sterelny| year=2007 | publisher=Icon Books| location = Cambridge, U.K. |isbn=1-84046-780-0 |page=164}} Also ISBN 978-1840467-80-2&lt;/ref&gt; Jablonka has been described as being in the vanguard of an ongoing revolution within evolutionary biology, and was a keynote speaker at the [[Artificial life|Artificial Life]] XI conference in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Proceedings11thConf&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/16740/1/ALIFExi_front-matter.pdf |title=Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on the Simulation and Synthesis of Living Systems | year=2008 | month=June| publisher= The MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn=978-0-262-75017-2 | page=vii | author=Seth Bullock, Jason Noble, Richard Watson, &amp; Mark A. Bedau (Eds)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Jablonka co-authored with [[Marion J. Lamb|Marion Lamb]] the book ''Evolution in Four Dimensions'', which is considered by some to be in the vanguard of an ongoing revolution within [[evolutionary biology]]. Building on the approach of [[evolutionary developmental biology]], and recent findings of [[molecular biology|molecular]] and behavioral biology, they argue the case for the transmission of not just genes per se, but heritable variations transmitted from generation to generation by whatever means. They suggest that such variation can occur at four levels. Firstly, at the established physical level of genetics. Secondly, at the epigenetic level involving variation in the “meaning” of given DNA strands, in which variations in DNA translation during developmental processes are subsequently transmitted during reproduction, which can then feed back into sequence modification of DNA itself. The third dimension is one of particular interest to Jablonka, comprising the transmission of behavioural traditions. There are for example documented cases of food preferences being passed on, by social learning, in several animal species, which remain stable from generation to generation while conditions permit. The fourth dimension is symbolic inheritance, which is unique to humans, and in which traditions are passed on “through our capacity for language, and culture, our representations of how to behave, communicated by speech and writing.” &lt;ref name=&quot;StevenRoseReview&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rose, Steven |title=Review of Jablonka &amp; Lamb's Evolution in Four Dimensions |journal=The Guardian |year=2005|month=23 July | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/jul/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview8 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In their treatment of the higher levels, Jablonka and Lamb distinguish their approach from the banalities of evolutionary psychology, of &quot;memes&quot;, and even from Chomskyian ideas of universal grammar. The argue that there are constant interactions between the levels - epigenetic, behavioural and even symbolic inheritance mechanisms also produce selection pressures on DNA-based inheritance and can, in some cases, even help direct DNA changes themselves - so &quot;evolving evolution&quot;. To liven their text, they utilise thought experiments and dialogue with a sceptical enquirer, one IM-Ifcha Mistraba, Aramaic, they say, for &quot;the opposite conjecture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;StevenRoseReview&quot; /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22426">'''Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation''' (MeDIP or mDIP) is a large-scale ([[chromosome]]- or [[genome]]-wide) purification technique in molecular biology that is used to enrich for [[DNA methylation|methylated DNA sequences]].  It consists of isolating methylated DNA fragments via an [[antibody]] raised against [[5-methylcytosine]] (5mC).  This technique was first described by Weber M. ''et al.''&lt;ref name=&quot;weber2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weber M, Davies JJ, Wittig D, ''et al.'' |title=Chromosome-wide and promoter-specific analyses identify sites of differential DNA methylation in normal and transformed human cells |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=853–62 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16007088 |doi=10.1038/ng1598}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has helped pave the way for viable [[methylome]]-level assessment efforts, as the purified fraction of methylated DNA can be input to high-throughput DNA detection methods such as high-resolution [[DNA microarray]]s ([[Tiling array#MeDIP-chip|MeDIP-chip]]) or [[DNA sequencing#New sequencing methods|next-generation sequencing]] (MeDIP-seq).  Nonetheless, understanding of the methylome remains rudimentary; its study is complicated by the fact that, like other [[epigenetic]] properties, patterns vary from cell-type to cell-type. 

== Background ==

[[DNA methylation]], referring to the reversible methylation of the 5 position of cytosine by [[DNA methyltransferase|methyltransferases]], is a major [[epigenetic]] modification in multicellular organisms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bird A |title=DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory |journal=Genes Dev. |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=6–21 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11782440 |doi=10.1101/gad.947102 |url=http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11782440}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In mammals, this modification primarily occurs at [[CpG sites]], which in turn tend to cluster in regions called [[CpG islands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(87)90689-9 |author=Gardiner-Garden M, Frommer M |title=CpG islands in vertebrate genomes |journal=J. Mol. Biol. |volume=196 |issue=2 |pages=261–82 |year=1987 |month=July |pmid=3656447 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022-2836(87)90689-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  There is a small fraction of CpG islands that can overlap or be in close proximity to promoter regions of transcription start sites.  The modification may also occur at other sites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clark SJ, Harrison J, Frommer M |title=CpNpG methylation in mammalian cells |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=20–7 |year=1995 |month=May |pmid=7647784 |doi=10.1038/ng0595-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but methylation at either of these sites can repress gene expression by either interfering with the binding of [[transcription factor]]s or modifying [[chromatin]] structure to a repressive state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jaenisch R, Bird A |title=Epigenetic regulation of gene expression: how the genome integrates intrinsic and environmental signals |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=33 |issue=Suppl |pages=245–54 |year=2003 |month=March |pmid=12610534 |doi=10.1038/ng1089}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Disease condition studies have largely fueled the effort in understanding the role of DNA methylation.  Currently, the major research interest lies in investigating disease conditions such as [[cancer]] to identify regions of the DNA that has undergone extensive methylation changes.  The genes contained in these regions are of functional interest as they may offer a mechanistic explanation to the underlying genetic causes of a disease.  For instance, the abnormal methylation pattern of cancer cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robertson KD, Wolffe AP |title=DNA methylation in health and disease |journal=Nat. Rev.

=== Other technologies ===

There are two approaches to methylation analysis: typing and profiling technologies.  Typing technologies are targeted towards a small number of loci across many samples, and involve the use of techniques such as [[PCR]], [[restriction enzymes]], and [[mass spectrometry]].  Profiling technologies such as MeDIP are targeted towards a [[genome]]- or [[methylome]]-wide level assessment of methylation; this includes [[restriction landmark genomic scanning]] (RLGS)&lt;ref name=&quot;hatada1991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.88.21.9523 |author=Hatada I, Hayashizaki Y, Hirotsune S, Komatsubara H, Mukai T |title=A genomic scanning method for higher organisms using restriction sites as landmarks |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=88 |issue=21 |pages=9523–7 |year=1991 |month=November |pmid=1946366 |pmc=52750 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[bisulfite sequencing|bisulfite conversion]]-based methods, which rely on the treatment of DNA with [[bisulfite]] to convert unmethylated [[cytosine]] residues to [[uracil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rakyan VK, Hildmann T, Novik KL, ''et al.'' |title=DNA Methylation Profiling of the Human Major Histocompatibility Complex: A Pilot Study for the Human Epigenome Project |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=e405 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15550986 |pmc=529316 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020405 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020405}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gitan RS, Shi H, Chen CM, Yan PS, Huang TH |title=Methylation-Specific Oligonucleotide Microarray: A New Potential for High-Throughput Methylation Analysis |journal=Genome Res. |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=158–64 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11779841 |pmc=155260 |doi=10.1101/gr.202801 |url=http://www.genome.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11779841}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meissner A, Gnirke A, Bell GW, Ramsahoye B, Lander ES, Jaenisch R |title=Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing for comparative high-resolution DNA methylation analysis |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=33 |issue=18 |pages=5868–77 |year=2005 |pmid=16224102 |pmc=1258174 |doi=10.1093/nar/gki901 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16224102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/30.5.e21 |author=Adorján P, Distler J, Lipscher E, ''et al.'' |title=Tumour class prediction and discovery by microarray-based DNA methylation analysis |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=e21 |year=2002 |month=March |pmid=11861926 |pmc=101257 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11861926}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Limitations of other technologies ===

Other methods mapping and profiling the methylome have been effective but are not without their limitations that can affect resolution, level of throughput, or experimental variations.  For instance, RLGS is limited by the number of restriction sites in genome that can be targets for the restriction enzyme; typically, a maximum of ~4100 landmarks can be assessed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dai Z, Weichenhan D, Wu YZ, ''et al.'' |title=An AscI Boundary Library for the Studies of Genetic and Epigenetic Alterations in CpG Islands |journal=Genome Res. |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=1591–8 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12368252 |pmc=187524 |doi=10.1101/gr.197402 |url=http://www.genome.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12368252}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Bisulfite sequencing]]-based methods, despite possible single-nucleotide resolution, have a drawback: the conversion of unmethylated cytosine to uracil can be unstable&lt;ref name=&quot;pomraning2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pomraning KR, Smith KM, Freitag M |title=Genome-wide high throughput analysis of DNA methylation in eukaryotes |journal=Methods |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=142–50 |year=2009 |month=March |pmid=18950712 |doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2008.09.022 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1046-2023(08)00182-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In addition, when bisulfite conversion is coupled with [[DNA microarrays]] to detect bisulfite converted sites, the reduced sequence complexity of DNA is a problem.  Microarrays capable of comprehensively profiling the whole-genome become difficult to design as fewer unique probes are available&lt;ref name=&quot;down2008&quot; /&gt;.

== Methods ==

The following sections outline the method of MeDIP coupled with either high-resolution array hybridization or high-throughput sequencing.  Each DNA detection method will also briefly describe post-laboratory processing and analysis.  Different post-processing of the raw data is required depending on the technology used to identify the methylated sequences.  This is analogous to data generated using [[ChIP-chip]] and [[Chip-Sequencing|ChIP-seq]].

[[File:Medip-final-3.jpg|thumb|400px|Workflow overview of the MeDIP procedure. MeDIP procedure is followed by array-hybridization (A) or high-throughput/next generation sequencing (B)]]

=== Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) ===

Genomic DNA is extracted ([[DNA extraction]]) from the cells and purified.  The purified DNA is then subjected to sonication to shear it into random fragments.  This sonication process is quick, simple, and avoids [[restriction enzyme]] biases.  The resulting fragments range from 300 to 1000 base pairs (bp) in length, although they are typically between 400 and 600 bp&lt;ref name=&quot;jacinto2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2144/000112708 |author=Jacinto FV, Ballestar E, Esteller M |title=Methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP): hunting down the DNA methylome |journal=BioTechniques |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=35, 37, 39 passim |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18254377 |url=http://www.biotechniques.com/article/000112708}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The short length of these fragments are important in obtaining adequate resolution, improving the efficiency of the downstream step in immunoprecipitation, and reducing fragment-length effects or biases.  Also, the size of the fragment affects the binding of 5-methyl-cytidine (5mC) antibody because the antibody needs more than just a single 5mC for efficient binding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/20.19.5085 |author=Meehan RR, Lewis JD, Bird AP |title=Characterization of MeCP2, a vertebrate DNA binding protein with affinity for methylated DNA |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=20 |issue=19 |pages=5085–92 |year=1992 |month=October |pmid=1408825 |pmc=334288 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1408825}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  To further improve binding affinity of the antibodies, the DNA fragments are denatured to produce single-stranded DNA.  Following denaturation, the DNA is incubated with [[monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal]] 5mC antibodies.  The classical [[immunoprecipitation]] technique is then applied: magnetic beads conjugated to anti-mouse-[[IgG]] are used to bind the anti-5mC antibodies, and unbound DNA is removed in the supernatant.  To purify the DNA, [[proteinase K]] is added to digest the antibodies and release the DNA, which can be collected and prepared for DNA detection.

=== MeDIP and array-based hybridization (MeDIP-chip) ===
{{See also|Tiling array#MeDIP-chip}}
{{See also|DNA microarray}}

A fraction of the input DNA obtained after the sonication step above is labeled with [[cyanine]]-5 (Cy5; red) deoxy-cytosine-triphosphate while the methylated DNA, enriched after the immunoprecipitation step, is labeled with [[cyanine]]-3 (Cy3; green).  The labeled DNA samples are cohybridized on a 2-channel, high-density genomic microarray to probe for presence and relative quantities.  The purpose of this comparison is identify sequences that show significant differential expression, thereby confirming the sequence of interest is enriched.  
Array-based identification of MeDIP sequences are limited to the array design.  As a result, the resolution is restricted to the probes in the array design.  There are additional standard steps required in signal processing to correct for hybridization issues such as noise, as is the case with most array technologies. 

See &lt;ref name=&quot;wilson2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zhang2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kangchen.com.cn/English/service/servicemain.asp?id=141 DNA methylation microarray]&lt;/ref&gt; for more details.

=== MeDIP and high-throughput sequencing (MeDIP-seq) ===

{{See also|DNA sequencing#New sequencing methods}}

The MeDIP-seq approach, i.e. the coupling of MeDIP with next generation, short-read sequencing technologies such as [[454 Life Sciences|454]], [[Illumina (company)]] (Solexa), was first described by Down ''et al.'' in 2008&lt;ref name=&quot;down2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Down TA, Rakyan VK, Turner DJ, ''et al.'' |title=A Bayesian deconvolution strategy for immunoprecipitation-based DNA methylome analysis |journal=Nat. Biotechnol. |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=779–85 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18612301 |pmc=2644410 |doi=10.1038/nbt1414}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The high-throughput sequencing of the methylated DNA fragments produces a large number of short reads (36-50bp&lt;ref name=&quot;illumina&quot;&gt;http://www.illumina.com/&lt;/ref&gt; or 400 bp&lt;ref name=&quot;company454&quot;&gt;http://www.454.com/&lt;/ref&gt;, depending on the technology).  The short reads are aligned to a reference genome using alignment software such as Mapping and Assembly with Quality ([http://maq.sf.net Maq]), which uses a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] approach, along with base and mapping qualities to model error probabilities for the alignments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Li H, Ruan J, Durbin R |title=Mapping short DNA sequencing reads and calling variants using mapping quality scores |journal=Genome Res. |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=1851–8 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18714091 |pmc=2577856 |doi=10.1101/gr.078212.108 |url=http://genome.cshlp.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18714091}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The reads can then be extended to represent the ~400 to 700 bp fragments from the sonication step.  The coverage of these extended reads can be used to estimate the methylation level of the region.  A [[biological database#Genome browsers|genome browser]] such as [http://www.ensembl.org Ensembl] can also be used to visualize the data.

Validation of the approach to assess quality and accuracy of the data can be done with [[quantitative PCR]].  This is done by comparing a sequence from the MeDIP sample against an unmethylated control sequence.  The samples are then run on a [[gel electrophoresis|gel]] and the band intensities are compared&lt;ref name=&quot;pomraning2009&quot; /&gt;.  The relative intensity serves as the guide for finding enrichment.  The results can also be compared with MeDIP-chip results to help determine coverage needed.

== Downstream bioinformatics analysis ==
[[File:Study-flow.jpg|thumb|275px|Simple workflow demonstrating a typical experiment using MeDIP-seq.]]

The DNA methylation level estimations can be confounded by varying densities of methylated CpG sites across the genome when observing data generated by MeDIP.  This can be problematic for analyzing CpG-poor (lower density) regions.  One reason for this density issue is its effect on the efficiency of immunoprecipitation. In their study, Down ''et al.''&lt;ref name=&quot;down2008&quot; /&gt; developed a tool to estimate absolute methylation levels from data generated by MeDIP by modeling the density of methylated CpG sites.  This tool is called [[Bayesian tool for methylation analysis (Batman)]].  The study reports the coverage of ~90% of all CpG sites in promoters, gene-coding regions, islands, and regulatory elements where methylation levels can be estimated; this is almost 20 times better coverage than any previous methods.

Studies using MeDIP-seq or MeDIP-chip are both genome-wide approaches that have the common aim of obtaining the functional mapping of the methylome. Once regions of DNA methylation are identified, a number of bioinformatics analyses can be applied to answer certain biological questions.  One obvious step is to investigate genes contained in these regions and investigate the functional significance of their repression. For example, silencing of tumour-suppressor genes in cancer can be attributed to DNA methylation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Esteller M |title=Epigenetic gene silencing in cancer: the DNA hypermethylome |journal=Hum. Mol. Genet. |volume=16 |issue=Spec No 1 |pages=R50–9 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17613547 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddm018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  By identifying mutational events leading to hypermethylation and subsequent repression of known tumour-suppressor genes, one can more specifically characterize the contributing factors to the cause of the disease.  Alternatively, one can identify genes that are known to be normally methylated but, as a result of some mutation event, is no longer silenced.   

Also, one can try and investigate and identify whether some epigenetic regulator has been affected such as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)&lt;ref name=&quot;jacinto2008&quot; /&gt;; in these cases, enrichment may be more limited.

== Limitations of MeDIP ==
Limitations to take note when using MeDIP are typical experimental factors.  This includes the quality and cross-reactivity of 5mC antibodies used in the procedure.  Furthermore, DNA detection methods (i.e. array hybridization and high-throughput sequencing) typically involve well established limitations.  Particularly for array-based procedures, as mentioned above, sequences being analyzed are limited to the specific array design used.

Most typical limitations to high-throughput, next generation sequencing apply.  The problem of alignment accuracy to repetitive regions in the genome will result in less accurate analysis of methylation in those regions.  Also, as was mentioned above, short reads (e.g. 36-50bp from an [http://www.illumina.com/pages.ilmn?ID=204 Illumina Genome Analyzer]) represent a part of a sheared fragment when aligned to the genome; therefore, the exact methylation site can fall anywhere within a window that is a function of the fragment size&lt;ref name=&quot;pomraning2009&quot; /&gt;.  In this respect, bisulfite sequencing has much higher resolution (down to a single CpG site; single nucleotide level).  However, this level of resolution may not be required for most applications, as the methylation status of CpG sites within &lt; 1000 bp has been shown to be significantly correlated&lt;ref name=&quot;down2008&quot;/&gt;.

== Applications of MeDIP ==

* Weber ''et al.'' 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;weber2005&quot; /&gt; determined that the inactive X-chromosome in females is hypermethylated on a chromosome wide level using MeDIP coupled with microarray.

* Keshet ''et al.'' 2006&lt;ref name=&quot;keshet2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keshet I, Schlesinger Y, Farkash S, ''et al.'' |title=Evidence for an instructive mechanism of de novo methylation in cancer cells |journal=Nat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64319">Somatic evolution is the accumulation of mutations in the cells of a body during a lifetime, and the effects of those mutations on the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of those cells. Somatic evolution is important in the process of aging as well as the development of some diseases, including cancer.

==Natural selection in cancer==
Cells in pre-malignant and [[malignant]] [[neoplasms]] ([[tumors]]) evolve by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowell 1976&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nowell |first=P. C. |year=1976 |title=The clonal evolution of tumor cell populations |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=194 |issue=4260 |pages=23–28 |doi=10.1126/science.959840 |pmid=959840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Merlo 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Merlo |first=L. M. |coauthors=Pepper, J. W.; Reid, B. J.; Maley, C. C. |year=2006 |title=Cancer as an evolutionary and ecological process |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=924–935 |doi=10.1038/nrc2013 |pmid=17109012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This accounts for how cancer develops from normal tissue and why it has been difficult to cure. There are three necessary and sufficient conditions for natural selection, all of which are met in a neoplasm:
# There must be variation in the population. Neoplasms are mosaics of different mutant cells with both genetic and [[epigenetic]] changes that distinguish them from normal cells.
# That variation must be heritable. When a cancer cell divides, both daughter cells inherit the genetic and epigenetic abnormalities of the parent cell, and may also acquire new genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in the process of cellular reproduction.
# That variation must affect survival or reproduction ([[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]).  While many of the genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in neoplasms are probably [[evolutionarily neutral|neutral evolution]], many have been shown to increase the proliferation of the mutant cells, or decrease their rate of death ([[apoptosis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanahan 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanahan |first=D. |coauthors=Weinberg, R. |year=2000 |title=The hallmarks of cancer |journal=[[Cell (journal)|Cell]] |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=57–70 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81683-9 |pmid=10647931}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Hallmarks]] below)

Cells in neoplasms compete for resources, such as oxygen and glucose, as well as space. Thus, a cell that acquires a mutation that increases its fitness will generate more daughter cells than competitor cells that lack that mutation. In this way, a population of mutant cells, called a clone, can expand in the neoplasm. [[Clonal expansion]] is the signature of natural selection in cancer.

Cancer therapies act as a form of artificial selection, killing sensitive cancer cells, but leaving behind [[Therapeutic Resistance|resistant cells]]. Often the tumor will regrow from those resistant cells, the patient will relapse, and the therapy that had been previously used will no longer kill the cancer cells. This selection for resistance is similar to the repeatedly spraying crops with a pesticide and selecting for resistant pests until the pesticide is no longer effective.

===Evolution in Complex Biological Systems===
Modern descriptions of biological evolution will typically elaborate on major contributing factors to evolution such as the formation of local micro-environments, mutational robustness, molecular [[Degeneracy_(biology) | degeneracy]], and cryptic genetic variation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitacre&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Whitacre | title =  Genetic and environment-induced pathways to innovation: on the possibility of a universal relationship between robustness and adaptation in complex biological systems (http://www.springerlink.com/content/0577136586542281/) |  journal = Evolutionary Ecology | date = (In press) | volume = | issue = | pages = | id = | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/0577136586542281/ | accessdate = 2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these contributing factors in evolution have been isolated and described for cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tian et al.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |  author = Tian et al. | title =  The origins of cancer robustness and evolvability |  journal = Integrative Biology | year = 2011 | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 17–30 | id = | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=20944865 | accessdate = 2011-03-11 |  doi = 10.1039/c0ib00046a |  pmid = 20944865 |  last2 = Olson |  first2 = S |  last3 = Whitacre |  first3 = JM |  last4 = Harding |  first4 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Multilevel selection===
Cancer is a classic example of what evolutionary biologists call [[multilevel selection]]: at the level of the organism, cancer is usually fatal so there is selection for genes and the organization of tissues&lt;ref name=&quot;Cairns 1975&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cairns |first=J. |year=1975 |title=Mutation Selection and the Natural History of Cancer |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=255 |issue=5505 |pages=197–200 |doi=10.1038/255197a0 |pmid=1143315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pepper |first=J.

At the level of the cell, there is selection for increased cell proliferation and survival, such that a mutant cell that acquires one of the [[hallmarks of cancer]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanahan 2000&quot; /&gt; (see below), will have a competitive advantage over cells that have not acquired the hallmark. Thus, at the level of the cell there is selection for cancer.

==History==
===Pre-Nowell &amp; Cairns===
The earliest ideas about neoplastic evolution come from Boveri&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Manchester KL |title=Theodor Boveri and the origin of malignant tumours |journal=Trends Cell Biol. |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=384–7 |year=1995 |month=October |pmid=14732055 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0962-8924(00)89080-7 |doi=10.1016/S0962-8924(00)89080-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed that tumors originated in chromosomal abnormalities passed on to daughter cells. In the decades that followed, cancer was recognized as having a clonal origin associated with chromosomal aberrations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Makino S |title=Further evidence favoring the concept of the stem cell in ascites tumors of rats |journal=Ann.

Early mathematical modeling of cancer, by [[Armitage–Doll multistage model of carcinogenesis|Armitage and Doll]], set the stage for the future development of the somatic evolutionary theory of cancer. Armitage and Doll explained the cancer incidence data, as a function of age, as a process of the sequential accumulation of somatic mutations (or other rate limiting steps)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Armitage P, Doll R |title=The Age Distribution of Cancer and a Multi-stage Theory of Carcinogenesis |journal=Br.

===Knudson, Cairns, and Nowell===
In 1971, Knudson published the 2-hit hypothesis for mutation and cancer based on statistical analysis of inherited and sporadic cases of retinoblastoma &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knudson AG |title=Mutation and Cancer: Statistical Study of Retinoblastoma |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=820–3 |year=1971 |month=April |pmid=5279523 |pmc=389051 |doi=10.1073/pnas.68.4.820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. He postulated that retinoblastoma developed as a consequence of two mutations; one of which could be inherited or somatic followed by a second somatic mutation. Cytogenetic studies localized the region to the long arm of chromosome 13, and molecular genetic studies demonstrated that tumorigenesis was associated with chromosomal mechanisms, such as mitotic recombination or non-disjunction, that could lead to homozygosity of the mutation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cavenee WK, Dryja TP, Phillips RA, ''et al.'' |title=Expression of recessive alleles by chromosomal mechanisms in retinoblastoma |journal=Nature |volume=305 |issue=5937 |pages=779–84 |year=1983 |pmid=6633649 |doi=10.1038/305779a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The retinoblastoma gene was the first tumor suppressor gene to be cloned in 1986.

Cairns hypothesized a different, but complementary, mechanism of tumor suppression in 1975 based on tissue architecture to protect against selection of variant somatic cells with increased fitness in proliferating epithelial populations, such as the intestine and other epithelial organs  &lt;ref name=&quot;Cairns 1975&quot;/&gt;. He postulated that this could be accomplished by restricting the number of stem cells for example at the base of intestinal crypts and restraining the opportunities for competition between cells by shedding differentiated intestinal cells into the gut. The essential predictions of this model have been confirmed although mutations in some tumor suppressor genes, including CDKN2A (p16), predispose to clonal expansions that encompass large numbers of crypts in some conditions such as Barrett’s esophagus. He also postulated an immortal DNA strand that is discussed at [[Immortal DNA strand hypothesis]].

Nowell synthesized the evolutionary view of cancer in 1976 as a process of genetic instability and natural selection&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowell 1976&quot;/&gt;. Most of the alterations that occur are deleterious for the cell, and those clones will tend to go extinct, but occasional selectively advantageous mutations arise that lead to clonal expansions. This theory predicts a unique genetic composition in each neoplasm due to the random process of mutations, genetic polymorphisms in the human population, and differences in the selection pressures of the neoplasm’s microenvironment. Interventions are predicted to have varying results in different patients. What is more important, the theory predicts the emergence of resistant clones under the selective pressures of therapy. Since 1976, researchers have identified clonal expansions&lt;ref name=&quot;Brash 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brash DE, Zhang W, Grossman D, Takeuchi S |title=Colonization of adjacent stem cell compartments by mutant keratinocytes |journal=Semin.

Many of the somatic evolutionary studies have traditionally been focused on clonal expansion, as recurrent types of changes can be traced to illustrate the evolutionary path based on available methods.  Recent studies from both direct DNA sequencing and karyotype analysis illustrate the importance of the high level of heterogeneity in somatic evolution.  For the formation of solid tumors, there is an involvement of multiple cycles of clonal and non-clonal expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heng 2006a&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heng 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heng |first=H.

In solid tumors, a majority of gene mutations are not recurrent types,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bielas 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bielas |first=J.

===Somatic evolution by epigenetics===
The state of a cell may be changed [[epigenetic]]ally, in addition to genetic alterations. The best-understood epigenetic alterations in tumors are the silencing or expression of genes by changes in the methylation of [[CpG site|CG pairs]] of nucleotides in the [[promotor (biology)|promoter]] regions of the genes. These methylation patterns are copied to the new chromosomes when cells replicate their genomes and so methylation alterations are heritable and subject to natural selection. Methylation changes are thought to occur more frequently than mutations in the DNA, and so may account for many of the changes during neoplastic progression (the process by which normal tissue becomes cancerous), in particular in the early stages. Epigenetic changes in progression interact with genetic changes. For example, epigenetic silencing of genes responsible for the repair of mutations in the DNA (e.g. MLH1 and MSH2) results in an increase of genetic mutations.

===Clonal expansions===
One common feature of neoplastic progression is the expansion of a clone with a genetic or epigenetic alteration. This may be a matter of chance, but is more likely due to the expanding clone having a competitive advantage (either a reproductive or survival advantage) over other cells in the tissue. Since clones often have many genetic and epigenetic alterations in their genomes, it is often not clear which of those alterations cause a reproductive or survival advantage and which other alterations are simply [[Genetic hitchhiking|hitchhikers]] or passenger mutations (see Glossary below) on the clonal expansion.

Clonal expansions are most often associated with the loss of the p53 (TP53) or p16 (CDKN2A/INK4a) tumor suppressor genes. In lung cancer, a clone with a p53 mutation was observed to have spread over the surface of one entire lung and into the other lung&lt;ref&gt;Franklin WA, Gazdar AF, Haney J, Wistuba, II, La Rosa FG, Kennedy T, Ritchey DM, Miller YE: Widely dispersed p53 mutation in respiratory epithelium.

These clonal expansions are important for at least two reasons. First, they generate a large target population of mutant cells and so increase the probability that the multiple mutations necessary to cause cancer will be acquired within that clone. Second, in at least one case, the size of the clone with loss of p53 has been associated with an increased risk of a pre-malignant tumor becoming cancerous&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maley CC, Galipeau PC, Li X, ''et al.'' |title=The combination of genetic instability and clonal expansion predicts progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=64 |issue=20 |pages=7629–33 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15492292 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-1738 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15492292}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Phylogenetic analyses===
[[Phylogenetics]] may be applied to cells in tumors to reveal the evolutionary relationships between cells, just as it is used to reveal evolutionary relationships between organisms and species. Shibata, Tavare and colleagues have exploited this to estimate the time between the initiation of a tumor and its detection in the clinic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsao 2000&quot; /&gt; Louhelainen ''et al.'' have used [[Maximum parsimony|parsimony]] to reconstruct the relationships between biopsy samples based on loss of heterozygosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Louhelainen, J. |coauthors=Wijkstrom, H.; Hemminki, K. |year=2000 |title=Initiation-development modelling of allelic losses on chromosome 9 in multifocal bladder cancer |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=1441–1451 |doi=10.1016/S0959-8049(00)00127-1 |pmid=10899659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phylogenetic trees should not be confused with oncogenetic trees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Desper R, Jiang F, Kallioniemi OP, Moch H, Papadimitriou CH, Schäffer AA |title=Inferring tree models for oncogenesis from comparative genome hybridization data |journal=J.

===Adaptive landscapes===
An adaptive landscape is a hypothetical topological landscape upon which evolution is envisioned to take place. It is similar to Wright's [[fitness landscape]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wright S |title=Evolution in Mendelian Populations |journal=Genetics |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=97–159 |year=1931 |month=March |pmid=17246615 |pmc=1201091 |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17246615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright S. Evolution and genetics of populations. Vol. 2, University of Chicago Press (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; in which the location of each point represents the genotype of an organism and the altitude represents the fitness of that organism in the current environment. However, unlike Wright's rigid landscape, the adaptive landscape is pliable.  It readily changes shape with changes in population densities and survival/reproductive strategies used within and among the various species.

Wright’s shifting balance theory of evolution combines [[genetic drift]] (random sampling error in the transmission of genes) and [[natural selection]] to explain how multiple peaks on a fitness landscape could be occupied or how a population can achieve a higher peak on this landscape. This theory, based on the assumption of [[density-dependent selection]] as the principle forms of selection, results in a fitness landscape that is relatively rigid. A rigid landscape is one that does not change in response to even large changes in the position and composition of strategies along the landscape.

In contrast to the fitness landscape, the adaptive landscape is constructed assuming that both density and frequency-dependent selection is involved (selection is frequency-dependant when the fitness of a species depends not only on that species strategy but also on the strategy of all other species). As such, the shape of the adaptive landscape can change drastically in response to even small changes in strategies and densities &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nowak MA, Sigmund K |title=Evolutionary dynamics of biological games |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5659 |pages=793–9 |year=2004 |month=February |pmid=14764867 |doi=10.1126/science.1093411 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14764867}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The flexibility of adaptive landscapes provide several ways for natural selection to cross valleys and occupy multiple peaks without having to make large changes in their strategies. Within the context of [[differential equation|differential]] or [[difference equation]] models for population dynamics, an adaptive landscape may actually be constructed using a [[Fitness Generating Function]] &lt;ref&gt;Vincent T. L. and Brown J. S. Evolutionary game theory, natural selection, and Darwinian dynamics. Cambridge University Press 2005&lt;/ref&gt;. If a given species is able to evolve, it will, over time, “climb” the adaptive landscape toward a fitness peak through gradual changes in its mean phenotype according to a strategy dynamic that involves the slope of the adaptive landscape. Because the adaptive landscape is not rigid and can change shape during the evolutionary process, it is possible that a species may be driven to maximum, minimum, or [[saddle point]] on the adaptive landscape. A population at a global maximum on the adaptive landscape corresponds an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS) and will become dominant, driving all others toward extinction. Populations at a minimum or saddle point are not resistant to invasion, so that the introduction of a slightly different mutant strain may continue the evolutionary process toward unoccupied local maxima.

The adaptive landscape provides a useful tool for studying somatic evolution as it can describe the process of how a mutant cell evolves from a small tumor to an invasive cancer. Understanding this process in terms of the adaptive landscape may lead to the control of cancer through external manipulation of the shape of the landscape &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vincent TL, Gatenby RA |title=An evolutionary model for initiation, promotion, and progression in carcinogenesis |journal=Int.

===''The Hallmarks of Cancer'' as evolutionary adaptations in a neoplasm===
In their landmark paper, ''The Hallmarks of Cancer'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanahan 2000&quot; /&gt; Hanahan and Weinberg suggest that cancer can be described by a small number of underlying principles, despite the complexities of the disease.   The authors describe how tumor progression proceeds via a process analogous to Darwinian evolution, where each genetic change confers a growth advantage to the cell.  These genetic changes can be grouped into six &quot;hallmarks&quot;, which drive a population of normal cells to become a cancer. The six hallmarks are: 
# self-sufficiency in growth signals
# insensitivity to antigrowth signals
# evasion of apoptosis
# limitless replicative potential
# sustained angiogenesis, and
# tissue invasion and metastasis.
Genetic instability is defined as an “enabling characteristic” that facilitates the acquisition of other mutations due to defects in DNA repair.

The hallmark &quot;self-sufficiency in growth signals&quot; describes the observation that tumor cells produce many of their own growth signals and thereby no longer rely on proliferation signals from the micro-environment.   Normal cells are maintained in a nondividing state by antigrowth signals, which cancer cells learn to evade through genetic changes producing &quot;insensitivity to antigrowth signals&quot;.    A normal cell initiates programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to signals such as DNA damage, oncogene overexpression, and survival factor insufficiency, but a cancer cell learns to &quot;evade apoptosis&quot;, leading to the accumulation of aberrant cells.  Most mammalian cells can replicate a limited number of times due to progressive shortening of telomeres; virtually all malignant cancer cells gain an ability to maintain their telomeres, conferring &quot;limitless replicative potential&quot;.  As cells cannot survive at distances of more than 100 μm from a blood supply, cancer cells must initiate the formation of new blood vessels to support their growth via the process of &quot;sustained angiogenesis&quot;.  During the development of most cancers, primary tumor cells acquire the ability to undergo &quot;invasion and metastasis&quot; whereby they migrate into the surrounding tissue and travel to distant sites in the body, forming secondary tumors.

The pathways that cells take toward becoming malignant cancers are variable, and the order in which the hallmarks are acquired can vary from tumor to tumor.  The early genetic events in tumorigenesis are difficult to measure clinically, but can be simulated according to known biology &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spencer SL, Gerety RA, Pienta KJ, Forrest S |title=Modeling Somatic Evolution in Tumorigenesis |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=e108 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16933983 |pmc=1550273 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020108 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020108}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Macroscopic tumors are now beginning to be described in terms of their underlying genetic changes, providing additional data to refine the framework described in The Hallmarks of Cancer.

==Clonal evolution and cancer stem cells==
===Monoclonal theory of cancer origin===
The theory about the monoclonal origin of cancer states that in general neoplasms arise from a single cell of origin&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowell 1976&quot;/&gt;. While it is possible that certain carcinogens may mutate more than one cell at once, the tumor mass usually represents progeny of a single cell, or very few cells&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowell 1976&quot;/&gt;. A series of mutations is required in the process of carcinogenesis for a cell to transition from being normal to pre-malignant and then to a cancer cell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Axelrod R, Axelrod DE, Pienta KJ |title=Evolution of cooperation among tumor cells |journal=Proc.

The mutated genes usually belong to classes of [[Caretaker gene|caretaker, gatekeeper, landscaper]] or several other genes. Mutation ultimately leads to acquisition of the six “hallmarks” of cancer.

The cancer stem-cell hypothesis relies on the fact that a lot of [[tumors]] are [[heterogeneous]] – the cells in the tumor vary by [[phenotype]] and functions&lt;ref name=&quot;Sh 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shackleton M, Quintana E, Fearon ER, Morrison SJ |title=Heterogeneity in cancer: cancer stem cells versus clonal evolution |journal=Cell |volume=138 |issue=5 |pages=822–9 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19737509 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.017 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092-8674(09)01030-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bapat&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bapat SA |title=Evolution of cancer stem cells |journal=Semin.

Med. |volume=58 |pages=267–84 |year=2007 |pmid=17002552 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.58.062105.204854 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.med.58.062105.204854?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Current research shows that in many cancers there is apparent [[hierarchy]] among cells&lt;ref name=&quot;Sh 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bapat&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalerba&quot;/&gt;. in general, there is a small population of cells in the tumor – about 0.2%-1% &lt;ref name=&quot;Bapat&quot;/&gt; – that exhibits stem cell-like properties. These cells have the ability to give rise to a variety of cells in tumor tissue, self-renew indefinitely, and upon transfer can form new tumors. According to the hypothesis, cancer stem cells are the only cells capable of [[tumorigenesis]] – initiation of a new tumor&lt;ref name=&quot;Sh 2009&quot;/&gt;. Cancer stem cell hypothesis might explain such phenomena as [[metastasis]] and [[remission (medicine)|remission]].

The monoclonal model of cancer and the cancer stem-cell model are not mutually exclusive&lt;ref name=&quot;Sh 2009&quot;/&gt;.  Cancer stem cell arises by clonal evolution as a result of [[selection]] for the cell with the highest fitness in the [[neoplasm]]. This way, the heterogeneous nature of neoplasm can be explained by two processes – clonal evolution, or the hierarchical [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of cells, regulated by cancer stem cells&lt;ref name=&quot;Sh 2009&quot;/&gt;. All cancers arise as a result of somatic evolution, but only some of them fit the cancer stem cell hypothesis&lt;ref name=&quot;Sh 2009&quot;/&gt;. The evolutionary processes do not cease when a population of cancer stem cells arises in a tumor. Cancer treatment drugs pose a strong selective force on all types of cells in tumors, including cancer stem cells, which would be forced to evolve resistance to the treatment. It is interesting to note that cancer stem cells do not always have to have the highest resistance among the cells in the tumor to survive [[chemotherapy]] and re-emerge afterwards. The surviving cells might be in a special [[microenvironment]], which protects them from adverse effects of treatment&lt;ref name=&quot;Sh 2009&quot;/&gt;.

It is currently unclear as to whether cancer stem cells arise from adult stem cell transformation, a maturation arrest of [[progenitor cells]], or as a result of [[dedifferentiation]] of mature cells &lt;ref name=&quot;Bapat&quot;/&gt;.

==Somatic evolution in therapeutic resistance==
Therapeutic resistance has been observed in virtually every form of therapy, from the beginning of cancer therapy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chabner BA, Roberts TG |title=Timeline: Chemotherapy and the war on cancer |journal=Nat. Rev. Cancer |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=65–72 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15630416 |doi=10.1038/nrc1529}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In most cases, therapies appear to select for mutations in the genes or pathways targeted by the drug.

===Resistance to Methotrexate===
Some of the first evidence for a genetic basis of acquired therapeutic resistance came from studies of methotrexate. Methotrexate inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene. However, methotrexate therapy appears to select for cells with extra copies (amplification) of DHFR, which are resistant to methotrexate. This was seen in both cell culture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schimke RT |title=Gene amplification, drug resistance, and cancer |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=1735–42 |year=1984 |month=May |pmid=6713376 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6713376}}&lt;/ref&gt; and samples from tumors in patients that had been treated with methotrexate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM198301273080406 |author=Curt GA, Carney DN, Cowan KH, ''et al.'' |title=Unstable methotrexate resistance in human small-cell carcinoma associated with double minute chromosomes |journal=N.

===Resistance to 5-Fluorouracil===
A common cytotoxic chemotherapy used in a variety of cancers, [[Fluorouracil|5-Fluorouracil]] (5-FU), targets the TYMS pathway and resistance can evolve through the evolution of extra copies of TYMS, thereby diluting the drug's effect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wang TL, Diaz LA, Romans K, ''et al.'' |title=Digital karyotyping identifies thymidylate synthase amplification as a mechanism of resistance to 5-fluorouracil in metastatic colorectal cancer patients |journal=Proc.

===Resistance to BCR-ABL targeting drugs===
In the case of Gleevec (Imatinib), which targets the BCR-ABL fusion gene in [[chronic myeloid leukemia]], resistance often develops through a mutation that changes the shape of the binding site of the drug&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gorre ME, Sawyers CL |title=Molecular mechanisms of resistance to STI571 in chronic myeloid leukemia |journal=Curr. Opin. Hematol. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=303–7 |year=2002 |month=July |pmid=12042704 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1065-6251&amp;volume=9&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=303 |doi=10.1097/00062752-200207000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roche-Lestienne C, Preudhomme C |title=Mutations in the ABL kinase domain pre-exist the onset of imatinib treatment |journal=Semin.

Sequential application of drugs can lead to the sequential evolution of resistance mutations to each drug in turn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shah NP, Skaggs BJ, Branford S, ''et al.'' |title=Sequential ABL kinase inhibitor therapy selects for compound drug-resistant BCR-ABL mutations with altered oncogenic potency |journal=J.

Gleevec is not as selective as was originally thought. It turns out that it targets other tyrosine kinase genes and can be used to control [[Gastrointestinal stromal tumor| gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs)]] that are driven by mutations in c-KIT. However, patients with GIST sometimes relapse with additional mutations in c-KIT that make the cancer cells resistant to Gleevec&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tamborini E, Bonadiman L, Greco A, ''et al.'' |title=A new mutation in the KIT ATP pocket causes acquired resistance to imatinib in a gastrointestinal stromal tumor patient |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=127 |issue=1 |pages=294–9 |year=2004 |month=July |pmid=15236194 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016508504002203 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2004.02.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chen LL, Trent JC, Wu EF, ''et al.'' |title=A missense mutation in KIT kinase domain 1 correlates with imatinib resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumors |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=64 |issue=17 |pages=5913–9 |year=2004 |month=September |pmid=15342366 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0085 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15342366}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Resistance to EGFR targeting drugs===
Gefitinib(Iressa) and Erlotinib (Tarceva) are epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors used for [[Lung cancer#Non-small_cell_lung_cancer|non-small cell lung cancer]] patients whose tumors have somatic mutations in EGFR.  However, most patients' tumors eventually become resistant to these drugs. Two major mechanisms of acquired resistance have been discovered in patients who have developed clinical resistance to Gefitinib or Erlotinib&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Engelman JA, Jänne PA |title=Mechanisms of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer |journal=Clin. Cancer Res. |volume=14 |issue=10 |pages=2895–9 |year=2008 |month=May |pmid=18483355 |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-2248 |url=http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18483355}}&lt;/ref&gt;: point mutations in the EGFR gene targeted by the drugs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kobayashi S, Boggon TJ, Dayaram T, ''et al.'' |title=EGFR mutation and resistance of non-small-cell lung cancer to gefitinib |journal=N.

Med. |volume=352 |issue=8 |pages=786–92 |year=2005 |month=February |pmid=15728811 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa044238 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&amp;pmid=15728811&amp;promo=ONFLNS19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and amplification of MET, another receptor tyrosine kinase, which can bypass EGFR to activate downstream signaling in the cell.  In an initial study, 22% of tumors with acquired resistance to Gefitinib or Erlotinib had MET amplification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Engelman JA, Zejnullahu K, Mitsudomi T, ''et al.'' |title=MET amplification leads to gefitinib resistance in lung cancer by activating ERBB3 signaling |journal=Science |volume=316 |issue=5827 |pages=1039–43 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17463250 |doi=10.1126/science.1141478 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17463250}}&lt;/ref&gt;. To address these issues, clinical trials are currently assessing irreversible EGFR inhibitors (which inihibit growth even in cell lines with mutations in EGFR), the combination of EGFR and MET kinase inhibitors, and [[Hsp90]] inihibitors (EGFR and MET both require Hsp90 proteins to fold properly).  In addition, taking repeated tumor biopsies from patients as they develop resistance to these drugs would help to understand the tumor dynamics.

===Resistance to selective estrogen receptor modulator drugs===
[[Selective estrogen receptor modulator|Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators]] (SERMs) are a commonly used adjuvant therapy in estrogen-receptor positive (ERα+) breast cancer and a preventive treatment for women at high risk of the disease.  There are several possible mechanisms of SERM resistance, though the relative clinical importance of each is debated.  These include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ring A, Dowsett M |title=Mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance |journal=Endocr. Relat. Cancer |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=643–58 |year=2004 |month=December |pmid=15613444 |doi=10.1677/erc.1.00776 |url=http://erc.endocrinology-journals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15613444}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Osborne CK |last2=Osborne |first2=C.

**Although this may be a mechanism of resistance in a minority of women, most ERα+ tumors that become resistant to SERMS remain ERα+&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnston SR, Saccani-Jotti G, Smith IE, ''et al.'' |title=Changes in estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and pS2 expression in tamoxifen-resistant human breast cancer |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=55 |issue=15 |pages=3331–8 |year=1995 |month=August |pmid=7614468 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7614468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance to anti-androgen therapy===
Most prostate cancers derive from cells that are stimulated to proliferate by androgens. Most prostate cancer therapies are therefore based on removing or blocking androgens. Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) have been observed in anti-androgen resistant prostate cancer that makes the AR hypersensitive to the low levels of androgens that remain after therapy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taplin ME, Bubley GJ, Ko YJ, ''et al.'' |title=Selection for androgen receptor mutations in prostate cancers treated with androgen antagonist |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=59 |issue=11 |pages=2511–5 |year=1999 |month=June |pmid=10363963 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10363963}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Likewise, extra copies of the AR gene (amplification) have been observed in anti-androgen resistant prostate cancer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Visakorpi T, Hyytinen E, Koivisto P, ''et al.'' |title=In vivo amplification of the androgen receptor gene and progression of human prostate cancer |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=401–6 |year=1995 |month=April |pmid=7795646 |doi=10.1038/ng0495-401}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These additional copies of the gene are thought to make the cell hypersensitive to low levels of androgens and so allow them to proliferate under anti-androgen therapy.

===Resistance to radiotherapy===
Resistance to radiotherapy is also commonly observed. However, to date, comparisons of malignant tissue before and after radiotherapy have not been done to identify genetic and epigenetic changes selected by exposure to radiation. In [[glioma]]s, a form of brain cancer, radiation therapy appears to select for stem cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bao |first=S. |coauthors=''et al.'' |year=2006 |title=Glioma stem cells promote radioresistance by preferential activation of the DNA damage response |journal=Nature |volume=444 |issue=7120 |pages=756–760 |doi=10.1038/nature05236 |pmid=17051156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is unclear if the tumor returns to the pre-therapy proportion of cancer stem cells after therapy or if radiotherapy selects for an alteration that keeps the glioma cells in the stem cell state.

==Harnessing evolution in therapeutics==
Cancer drugs and therapies commonly used today are evolutionary inert and represent a strong selection force, which leads to drug resistance&lt;ref name=&quot;Pepper&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pepper JW, Findlay CS, Kassen R, Spencer SL, Maley CC |title=Cancer research meets evolutionary biology |journal=Evol. Appl. |volume=2 |issue= |pages=62–70 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2008.00063.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A possible way to avoid that is to use a treatment agent that would co-evolve alongside with cancer cells.

===Anoxic bacteria===
[[Hypoxia (medical)|Anoxic]] bacteria could be used as competitors or predators in [[Hypoxia (environment)|hypoxic]] environments within tumors&lt;ref name=&quot;Pepper&quot;/&gt;. Scientists have been interested in the idea of using anoxic bacteria for over 150 years, but until recently there has been little progress in that field. According to Jain and Forbes, several requirements have to be met by the cells to qualify as efficient anticancer bacterium:&lt;ref name=&quot;Jain&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jain RK, Forbes NS |title=Can engineered bacteria help control cancer? |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=98 |issue=26 |pages=14748–50 |year=2001 |month=December |pmid=11752416 |pmc=64926 |doi=10.1073/pnas.261606598 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11752416}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
1.The bacterium cannot be toxic to the host
2.Its population should be restricted to the tumor mass
3.It should be able to disperse evenly throughout the neoplasm
4.At the end of the treatment bacterium should be easily eliminated from the host
5.It should not be causing severe immune response
6.It should be able to cause tumor cells death through competition for nutrients. 
In the process of the treatment cancer cells are most likely to evolve some form of resistance to the bacterial treatment. However, being a living organism, bacteria would coevolve with tumor cells, potentially eliminating the possibility of resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jain&quot;/&gt;

====Possible limitations====
Since bacteria prefer an anoxic environment, they are not efficient at eliminating cells on the periphery of the tumor, where oxygen supply is efficient. A combination of bacterial treatment with chemical drugs will increase chances of destroying the tumor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jain&quot;/&gt;

===Oncolytic viruses===
[[Oncolytic viruses]] are engineered to infect cancerous cells. Limitations of that method include immune response to the virus and the possibility of the virus evolving into a [[pathogen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pepper&quot;/&gt;

===Natural selection===
By manipulating the tumor environment we can create favorable conditions for the cells with least resistance to chemotherapy drugs to become more fit and outcompete the rest of the population.  The chemotherapy, administered directly after, should wipe out the predominant tumor cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pepper&quot;/&gt;

==Glossary==
Mapping between common terms from cancer biology and evolutionary biology

* '''Driver mutation''' = a mutation that gives a selective advantage to a clone in its microenvironment, through either increasing its survival or reproduction. Driver mutations tend to cause clonal expansions.
* '''Passenger mutation''' =  a mutation that has no effect on the fitness of a clone but may be associated with a clonal expansion because it occurs in the same genome with a driver mutation. This is known as a [[Genetic hitchhiking|hitchhiker]] in evolutionary biology.
* '''Clone''' = a set of cells that all descend from a common ancestor cell. A clone is usually distinguished through inheritance of a distinctive genetic lesion (mutation) that occurred in the ancestor cell.
* '''Neoplastic progression''' = the somatic evolutionary process by which normal tissue changes into malignant (cancerous) tissue.

The '''PHD finger''' (Plant Homeo [[Structural domain|Domain]]) was discovered in 1993 as a Cys&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-His-Cys&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; motif in the homeodomain [[protein]] HAT3 in Arabidopsis thaliana. 
The PHD finger motif resembles the metal binding [[RING domain]] (Cys&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-His-Cys&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[FYVE domain]]. It occurs as a single finger, but often in clusters of two or three, and it also occurs together with other domains, such as the [[chromodomain]] and the [[bromodomain]].

== PHD finger in proteins related to epigenetics ==
The PHD finger, approximately 50-80 aminoacids in length, is found in more than 100 human proteins. Several of the proteins it occurs in are found in the nucleus, and are involved in [[chromatin]]-mediated [[Regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]]. The PHD finger occurs in proteins such as the transcriptional co-activators [[EP300|p300]] and [[CREB binding protein|CBP]], [[Polycomb-group proteins|Polycomb]]-like protein (Pcl), [[Trithorax-group proteins]] like [[ASH1L]], [[ASH2L]] and [[MLL (gene)|MLL]], the [[autoimmune regulator]] (AIRE), [[Mi-2 complex]] (part of histone deacetylase complex), the co-repressor TIF1, the newly discovered JARID1-family of demethylases and many more.

== Structure data on the PHD finger ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:BPTF_PHD_finger_2F6N.jpg|thumb|]] --&gt;
The NMR structure of the PHD finger from human [[BAZ1B|WSTF]] ([[Williams Syndrome]] Transcription Factor) shows that the conserved [[cysteine]]s and [[histidine]] coordinate two Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. In general, the PHD finger adopts a globular fold, consisting of a two-stranded [[beta-sheet]] and an [[alpha-helix]]. The region consisting of these [[secondary structure]]s and the residues involved in coordinating the [[zinc]]-ions are very conserved among species. The loop regions I and II are variable and could contribute functional specificity to the different PHD fingers. 

== Function of the PHD finger ==
Recently the PHD fingers of some proteins, including [[ING2]], YNG1 and NURF, have been reported to bind to [[histone]] H3 tri-[[Methylation|methylated]] on [[lysine]] 4 (H3K4me3), while other PHD fingers have tested negative in such assays. Interestingly, a protein called SMCX (or [[JARID1C]]) has a PHD finger, which has been reported to bind histone H3 tri-methylated lysine 9 (H3K9me3). Based on these recent publications, binding to tri-methylated lysines on histones may therefore be a property widespread among PHD fingers. Domains that bind to modified histones, are called ''[[epigenetic]] readers'' as they specifically recognize the modified version of the residue and binds to it. 
The modification H3K4me3 is associated with the transcription start site of active genes, while H3K9me3 is associated with inactive genes. The modifications of the histone lysines are dynamic, as there are [[methylase]]s that add methyl groups to the lysines, and there are [[demethylase]]s that remove methyl groups. The SMCX protein is actually a histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase, which means it is an enzyme that can remove the methyl groups of lysine 4 on histone 3 (making it H3K4me2 or H3K4me1). One can only speculate if the H3K9me3-binding of SMCX PHD domain provides a crosstalk between trimethylation of H3K9 and the demethylation of H3K4me3. Such crosstalks have been suggested earlier with other domains involved in chromatin regulation, and may provide a strictly coordinated regulation.

Another example is the PHD finger of the BHC80/[[PHF21A]] protein, which is a component of the [[LSD1]] complex.  In this complex, LSD1 specifically demethylates H3K4me2 to H3K4me0, and BHC80 binds H3K4me0 through its PHD finger to stabilize the complex at its target promoters, presumably to prevent further re-methylation.  This is the first example of a PHD finger recognizing lysine methyl-zero status.

'''Gene silencing''' is a general term describing [[epigenetic]] processes of [[gene regulation]]. The term gene silencing is generally used to describe the &quot;switching off&quot; of a gene by a mechanism other than [[genetic modification]]. That is, a gene which would be expressed (turned on) under normal circumstances is switched off by machinery in the cell.

[[Gene]]s are regulated at either the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcriptional]] or [[Translation (biology)|post-transcriptional]] level. 

Transcriptional gene silencing is the result of [[histone]] modifications, creating an environment of [[heterochromatin]] around a gene that makes it inaccessible to transcriptional machinery ([[RNA polymerase]], [[transcription factors]], etc.). 

Post-transcriptional gene silencing is the result of [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] of a particular gene being destroyed or blocked. The destruction of the mRNA prevents [[translation]] to form an active gene product (in most cases, a [[protein]]). A common mechanism of post-transcriptional gene silencing is [[RNAi]]. 

Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing are used to regulate endogenous genes. Mechanisms of gene silencing also protect the organism's genome from [[transposon]]s and [[virus]]es. Gene silencing thus may be part of an ancient immune system protecting from such infectious [[DNA]] elements.

Genes may be silenced by [[DNA methylation]] during [[meiosis]], as in the filamentous fungus [[Neurospora crassa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1809">A '''somatic epitype''' is a non-heritable [[epigenetic]] alteration in a gene.  It is similar to conventional epigenetics in that it does not involve changes in the [[DNA]] primary sequence.  Physically, the somatic epitype corresponds to changes in DNA [[methylation]], oxidative damage (replacement of [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] with oxo-8-dGTP), or changes in DNA-[[chromatin]] structure that are not reversed by normal cellular or nuclear repair mechanisms.  Somatic epitypes alter gene expression levels without altering the amino acid sequence of the expressed protein.  Current research suggests that somatic epitypes can be altered both before and after birth, and this alteration can be in response to exposure to heavy metals (such as [[lead]]), differences in maternal care, or nutritional or behavioral stress.  There is no indication that somatic epitypes are heritable in a conventional epigenetic fashion.  Some research suggests that methylation levels (and gene expression) can be reversed for some somatic epitypes by alterations in environmental factors such as diet.

'''Heredity''' is the passing of traits to offspring (from its parent or ancestors). This is the process by which an offspring [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organism]] acquires or becomes predisposed to the characteristics of its parent cell or organism. Through heredity, variations exhibited by individuals can accumulate and cause some [[species]] to [[evolution|evolve]]. The study of heredity in [[biology]] is called [[genetics]], which includes the field of [[epigenetics]]. 

==Overview==
[[File:ADN static.png|thumb|left|200px|[[DNA]] structure. [[nucleobase|Bases]] are in the centre, surrounded by phosphate–sugar chains in a [[double helix]].]]
In humans, [[eye color]] is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the &quot;brown-eye trait&quot; from one of the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sturm RA, Frudakis TN |title=Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=327–32 |year=2004 |pmid=15262401 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inherited traits are controlled by [[gene]]s and the complete set of genes within an organism's [[genome]] is called its [[genotype]].&lt;ref name=Pearson_2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pearson H |title=Genetics: what is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=398–401 |year=2006 |pmid=16724031 |doi=10.1038/441398a |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called its [[phenotype]]. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Visscher PM, Hill WG, Wray NR |title=Heritability in the genomics era—concepts and misconceptions |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=255–66 |year=2008 |pmid=18319743 |doi=10.1038/nrg2322 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, [[sun tanning|suntanned]] skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in their genotype; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of [[albinism]], who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to [[sunburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oetting WS, Brilliant MH, King RA |title=The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal=Molecular medicine today |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=330–5 |year=1996 |pmid=8796918 |doi=10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritable traits are known to be passed from one generation to the next via [[DNA]], a [[molecule]] that encodes genetic information.&lt;ref name=Pearson_2006/&gt; DNA is a long [[polymer]] composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a word. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called [[gene]]s; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within [[cell (biology)|cells]], the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called [[chromosome]]s. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called [[allele]]s. DNA sequences can change through [[mutation]]s, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{cite book |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas J. |authorlink=Douglas J. Futuyma |year=2005 |title=Evolution |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |isbn=0-87893-187-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by [[quantitative trait locus|multiple interacting genes]] within and among organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Phillips PC |title=Epistasis—the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems |journal=Nat.

Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by direct agency of the DNA molecule. These phenomena are classed as [[epigenetic]] inheritance systems that are causally or independently evolving over genes. Research into modes and mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance is still in its scientific infancy, however, this area of research has attracted much recent activity as it broadens the scope of heritability and evolutionary biology in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jablonk09&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jablonka|first1=E.|last2=Raz|first2=G.|title=Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: Prevalence, mechanisms, and implications for the study of heredity and evolution.|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=84|issue=2|pages=131–176|year=2009|url=http://compgen.unc.edu/wiki/images/d/df/JablonkaQtrRevBio2009.pdf|pmid=19606595|doi=10.1086/598822}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA methylation]] marking [[chromatin]], self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by [[RNA interference]], and the three dimensional [[Protein structure|conformation]] of proteins (such as [[prions]]) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bossdorf10&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bossdorf|first1=O.|last2=Arcuri|first2=D.|last3=Richards|first3=C.

==Relation to theory of evolution==
{{Main|Charles Darwin}}
{{See also|Evolution}}
When [[Charles Darwin]] proposed his theory of [[evolution]] in 1859, one of its major problems was the lack of an underlying mechanism for heredity.  Darwin believed in a mix of blending inheritance and the inheritance of acquired [[Trait (biology)|trait]]s ([[pangenesis]]). Blending inheritance would lead to uniformity across populations in only a few generations and thus would remove variation from a population on which natural selection could act.  This led to Darwin adopting some Lamarckian ideas in later editions of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' and his later biological works. Darwin's primary approach to heredity was to outline how it appeared to work (noticing that traits that were not expressed explicitly in the parent at the time of reproduction could be inherited, that certain traits could be [[sex]]-linked, etc.) rather than suggesting mechanisms.

Darwin's initial model of heredity was adopted by, and then heavily modified by, his cousin [[Francis Galton]], who laid the framework for the [[biometric]] school of heredity. Galton rejected the aspects of Darwin's pangenesis model, which relied on acquired traits.

The inheritance of acquired traits was shown to have little basis in the 1880s when [[August Weismann]] cut the [[tail]]s off many generations of [[mouse|mice]] and found that their offspring continued to develop tails.

== History ==
The [[ancient history|ancients]] had a variety of ideas about heredity: [[Theophrastus]] proposed that male flowers caused female flowers to ripen; [[Hippocrates]] speculated that &quot;seeds&quot; were produced by various body parts and transmitted to offspring at the time of conception; and [[Aristotle]] thought that male and female semen mixed at conception. [[Aeschylus]], in [[458 BC]], proposed the male as the parent, with the female as a &quot;nurse for the young life sown within her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Eumenides'' 658-661&lt;/ref&gt;

Various hereditary mechanisms were envisaged without being properly tested or quantified.  These included [[blending inheritance]] and the [[inheritance of acquired traits]].  Nevertheless, people were able to develop domestic breeds of animals as well as crops through [[artificial selection]].  The inheritance of acquired traits also formed a part of early [[Lamarckian]] ideas on evolution.

During the 18th century, Dutch microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632–1723) discovered &quot;animalcules&quot; in the sperm of humans and other animals. Some scientists speculated they saw a &quot;little man&quot; ([[homunculus]]) inside each [[spermatozoon|sperm]]. These scientists formed a school of thought known as the &quot;spermists.&quot; They contended the only contributions of the female to the next generation were the womb in which the homunculus grew, and prenatal influences of the womb. An opposing school of thought, the ovists, believed that the future human was in the egg, and that sperm merely stimulated the growth of the egg. Ovists thought women carried eggs containing boy and girl children, and that the gender of the offspring was determined well before conception.

However, his work was not widely known and was rediscovered in 1901. It was initially assumed the Mendelian inheritance only accounted for large (qualitative) differences, such as those seen by Mendel in his pea plants&amp;mdash;and the idea of additive effect of (quantitative) genes was not realised until [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]]'s (1918) paper, &quot;[[The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]&quot;  Mendel's overall contribution gave scientists an useful overview that traits were inheritable.

===Modern development of genetics and heredity===
{{Main|History of genetics|Modern evolutionary synthesis}}
In the 1930s, work by Fisher and others resulted in a combination of Mendelian and biometric schools into the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]. The modern synthesis bridged the gap between experimental geneticists and naturalists; and between both and palaeontologists, stating that:&lt;ref&gt;Mayr &amp; Provine 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayr E. 1982. ''The growth of biological thought: diversity, evolution &amp; inheritance''. Harvard, Cambs. p567 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

#All evolutionary phenomena can be explained in a way consistent with known genetic mechanisms and the observational evidence of naturalists.
#Evolution is gradual: small genetic changes, recombination ordered by natural selection. Discontinuities amongst species (or other taxa) are explained as originating gradually through geographical separation and extinction (not saltation).
#[[Natural selection|Selection]] is overwhelmingly the main mechanism of change; even slight advantages are important when continued. The object of selection is the [[phenotype]] in its surrounding environment. The role of [[genetic drift]] is equivocal; though strongly supported initially by [[Dobzhansky]], it was downgraded later as results from ecological genetics were obtained.
#The primacy of population thinking: the genetic diversity carried in natural populations is a key factor in evolution. The strength of natural selection in the wild was greater than expected; the effect of ecological factors such as niche occupation and the significance of barriers to gene flow are all important.
#In palaeontology, the ability to explain historical observations by extrapolation from micro to macro-evolution is proposed. Historical contingency means explanations at different levels may exist. Gradualism does not mean constant rate of change.

The idea that [[speciation]] occurs after populations are reproductively isolated has been much debated. In plants, polyploidy must be included in any view of speciation. Formulations such as 'evolution consists primarily of changes in the [[allele frequency|frequencies of alleles]] between one generation and another' were proposed rather later. The traditional view is that developmental biology ('[[evo-devo]]') played little part in the synthesis, but an account of [[Gavin de Beer]]'s work by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggests he may be an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Gould S.J. ''Ontogeny and phylogeny''. Harvard 1977. p221-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all aspects of the synthesis have been challenged at times, with varying degrees of success. There is no doubt, however, that the synthesis was a great landmark in evolutionary biology. It cleared up many confusions, and was directly responsible for stimulating a great deal of research in the post-[[World War II]] era.

[[Trofim Lysenko]] however caused a backlash of what is now called [[Lysenkoism]] in the [[Soviet Union]] when he emphasised [[Lamarckian]] ideas on the [[inheritance of acquired traits]]. This movement affected agricultural research and led to food shortages in the 1960s and seriously affected the USSR.

==Types of heredity==

'''Dominant and recessive'''

An [[allele]] is said to be dominant if it is always expressed in the appearance of an organism (phenotype). For example, in peas the allele for green pods, G, is dominant to that for yellow pods, g. Since the allele for green pods is dominant, pea plants with the pair of alleles GG (homozygote) or Gg (heterozygote) will have green pods. The allele for yellow pods is recessive. The effects of this allele are only seen when it is present in both chromosomes, gg (homozygote).

The description of a mode of biological inheritance consists of three main categories:

:'''1. Number of involved [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]'''
:*[[Monogenetic]] (also called &quot;simple&quot;) – one [[Locus (genetics)|locus]]
:*[[Oligogenetic]] – few loci
:*[[Polygenetic]] – many loci

:'''2. Involved [[chromosome]]s'''
:*[[Autosomal]] – loci are not situated on a [[sex chromosome]]
:*[[Gonosomal]] – loci are situated on a [[sex chromosome]]
:**X-chromosomal – loci are situated on the [[X chromosome | X-chromosome]] (the more common case)
:**Y-chromosomal – loci are situated on the [[Y chromosome | Y-chromosome]]
:*[[Mitochondrial]] – loci are situated on the [[mitochondrial DNA]]

:'''3. Correlation [[genotype]]–[[phenotype]]'''
:*[[Dominance_relationship#Dominant_allele|Dominant]]
:*[[Intermediate]] (also called &quot;codominant&quot;)
:*[[Recessive]]

These three categories are part of every exact description of a mode of inheritance in the above order. In addition, more specifications may be added as follows:

:'''4. Coincidental and environmental interactions'''

:*[[Penetrance]]
:**Complete
:**Incomplete (percentual number)
:*[[Expressivity]]
:**Invariable
:**Variable
:*[[Heritability]] (in polygenetic and sometimes also in oligogenetic modes of inheritance)
:*Maternal or paternal [[imprinting (genetics)|imprinting]] phenomena (also see [[epigenetics]])

:'''5. Sex-linked interactions'''

:*Sex-linked inheritance ([[gonosomal]] loci)
:*[[Sex-limited]] phenotype expression (e.g., [[cryptorchism]])
:*Inheritance through the maternal line (in case of 
:*Inheritance through the paternal line (in case of [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosomal]] loci)

:'''6. Locus–locus interactions'''
:*[[Epistasis]] with other loci (e.g., [[overdominance]])
:*[[Gene coupling]] with other loci (also see [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]])
:*Homozygotous [[lethal factor]]s
:*[[Semi-lethal factor]]s

Determination and description of a mode of inheritance is achieved primarily through statistical analysis of pedigree data. In case the involved loci are known, methods of [[molecular genetics]] can also be employed.
