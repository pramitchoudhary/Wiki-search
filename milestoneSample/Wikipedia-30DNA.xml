The [[atoms]] in the structure are colour coded by [[element]] and the detailed structure of two base pairs is shown in the bottom right.]][[File:ADN animation.gif|thumb|The structure of part of a DNA [[double helix]]]]

'''Deoxyribonucleic acid''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Deoxyribonucleic_acid.ogg|d|i|ˌ|ɒ|k|s|i|ˌ|r|aɪ|b|ɵ|.|n|juː|ˌ|k|l|eɪ|.|ɨ|k|_|ˈ|æ|s|ɪ|d}}; '''DNA''') is a [[nucleic acid]] containing the [[genetics|genetic]] instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living [[organism]]s (with the exception of [[RNA virus]]es). The DNA segments carrying this genetic information are called [[gene]]s.  Likewise, other DNA sequences have structural purposes, or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information. Along with [[RNA]] and [[proteins]], DNA is one of the three major [[macromolecules]] that are essential for all known forms of [[life]]. 

DNA consists of two long [[polymers]] of simple units called [[nucleotide]]s, with [[backbone chain|backbone]]s made of [[Monosaccharide|sugar]]s and [[phosphate]] groups joined by [[ester]] bonds. These two strands run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called [[nucleobases]] (informally, ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes information. This information is read using the [[genetic code]], which specifies the sequence of the [[amino acid]]s within proteins. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related nucleic acid RNA in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].

Within cells DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. During [[cell division]] these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] and some of their DNA in [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondria]] or [[chloroplasts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Peter | title = iGenetics | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-8053-4553-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]]. Within the chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins such as [[histone]]s compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

In living organisms DNA does not usually exist as a single molecule, but instead as a pair of molecules that are held tightly together.&lt;ref name=FWPUB&gt;{{cite journal| author = Watson J.D. and Crick F.H.C. | pmid=13054692 | doi = 10.1038/171737a0 | url= http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf | title=A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid | journal=Nature | volume=171 | pages=737–738 | year=1953 | accessdate=4 May 2009|format=PDF| issue = 4356 | bibcode=1953Natur.171..737W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berg&gt;Berg J., Tymoczko J. and Stryer L.

The nucleotide repeats contain both the segment of the backbone of the molecule, which holds the chain together, and a nucleobase, which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix. A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a [[nucleoside]] and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a [[nucleotide]]. Polymers comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) are called a [[polynucleotide]].&lt;ref name=IUPAC&gt;[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/naabb.html Abbreviations and Symbols for Nucleic Acids, Polynucleotides and their Constituents] IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN).

The backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating [[phosphate]] and [[carbohydrate|sugar]] residues.&lt;ref name=Ghosh&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ghosh A, Bansal M |title=A glossary of DNA structures from A to Z |journal=Acta Crystallogr D |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=620–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12657780 |doi=10.1107/S0907444903003251}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sugar in DNA is [[deoxyribose|2-deoxyribose]], which is a [[pentose]] (five-[[carbon]]) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form [[phosphodiester bond]]s between the third and fifth carbon [[atom]]s of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric [[covalent bond|bonds]] mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are ''antiparallel''. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are called the [[directionality (molecular biology)|5′]] (''five prime'') and [[directionality (molecular biology)|3′]] (''three prime'') ends, with the 5' end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3' end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar [[ribose]] in RNA.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt;

The DNA double helix is stabilized primarily by two forces: [[hydrogen bond]]s between nucleotides and [[Stacking (chemistry)|base-stacking]] interactions among the [[aromatic]] nucleobases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yakovchuk2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yakovchuk P, Protozanova E, Frank-Kamenetskii MD |title=Base-stacking and base-pairing contributions into thermal stability of the DNA double helix |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=564–74 |year=2006 |pmid=16449200 |pmc=1360284 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkj454 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aqueous environment of the cell, the conjugated [[Pi bond|π bonds]] of nucleotide bases align perpendicular to the axis of the DNA molecule, minimizing their interaction with the [[solvation shell]] and therefore, the [[Gibbs free energy]].  The four bases found in DNA are [[adenine]] (abbreviated A), [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G) and [[thymine]] (T). These four bases are attached to the sugar/phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as shown for [[adenosine monophosphate]].

The nucleobases are classified into two types: the [[purine]]s, A and G, being fused five- and six-membered [[heterocyclic compound]]s, and the [[pyrimidine]]s, the six-membered rings C and T.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt; A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, [[uracil]] (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a [[methyl group]] on its ring. Uracil is not usually found in DNA, occurring only as a breakdown product of cytosine. In addition to RNA and DNA a large number of artificial [[nucleic acid analogues]] have also been created to study the proprieties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Verma S, Eckstein F |title=Modified oligonucleotides: synthesis and strategy for users |journal=Annu.

[[File:DNA-ligand-by-Abalone.png|left|thumb|Major and minor grooves of DNA. Minor groove is a binding site for the dye [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst 33258]].]]

===Grooves===

Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found by tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a [[binding site]]. As the strands are not directly opposite each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22&amp;nbsp;Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12&amp;nbsp;Å wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wing R, Drew H, Takano T, Broka C, Tanaka S, Itakura K, Dickerson R |title=Crystal structure analysis of a complete turn of B-DNA |journal=Nature |volume=287 |issue=5784 |pages=755–8 |year=1980 |pmid=7432492 |doi=10.1038/287755a0|bibcode = 1980Natur.287..755W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrowness of the minor groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove. As a result, proteins like [[transcription factor]]s that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contacts to the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pabo1984&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pabo C, Sauer R |title=Protein-DNA recognition |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=53 |pages=293–321 |year=1984 |pmid=6236744 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.53.070184.001453}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell ''(see below)'', but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.

===Base pairing===
{{Further|[[Base pair]]}}

In a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand normally interacts with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called complementary [[base pair]]ing. Here, purines form [[hydrogen bond]]s to pyrimidines, with A bonding only to T, and C bonding only to G. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a base pair. As hydrogen bonds are not [[covalent bond|covalent]], they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can therefore be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clausen-Schaumann H, Rief M, Tolksdorf C, Gaub H |title=Mechanical stability of single DNA molecules |pmc=1300792 |journal=Biophys J |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=1997–2007 |year=2000 |pmid=10733978 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76747-6 |bibcode=2000BpJ....78.1997C}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. Indeed, this reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.&lt;ref name=Alberts/&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;border: none; width:282px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;thumbcaption&quot;&gt;Top, a '''GC''' base pair with three [[hydrogen bond]]s. Bottom, an '''AT''' base pair with two hydrogen bonds. Non-covalent hydrogen bonds between the pairs are shown as dashed lines.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The two types of base pairs form different numbers of hydrogen bonds, AT forming two hydrogen bonds, and GC forming three hydrogen bonds (see figures, right).
DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low GC-content. Although it is often stated that this is due to the added stability of an additional hydrogen bond, this is incorrect.{{source?|date=October 2011}} DNA with high GC-content is more stable due to intra-strand base stacking interactions.{{cn|date=November 2011}}

As noted above, most DNA molecules are actually two polymer strands, bound together in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double stranded structure (dsDNA) is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart – a process known as melting – to form two ss DNA molecules. Melting occurs when conditions favor ssDNA; such conditions are high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).
The stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the GC-content (% G,C basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in various ways; a common way is the &quot;melting temperature&quot;, which is the temperature at which 50% of the ds molecules are converted to ss molecules; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA.
As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determine the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chalikian T, Völker J, Plum G, Breslauer K |title=A more unified picture for the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex melting: A characterization by calorimetric and volumetric techniques |pmc=22151 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=96 |issue=14 |pages=7853–8 |year=1999 |pmid=10393911 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.14.7853|bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.7853C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT [[Pribnow box]] in some [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s, tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=deHaseth P, Helmann J |title=Open complex formation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase: the mechanism of polymerase-induced strand separation of double helical DNA |journal=Mol Microbiol |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=817–24 |year=1995 |pmid=7476180 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.tb02309.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature required to break the hydrogen bonds, their [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] (also called ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These {{Anchor|ssDNA}}single-stranded DNA molecules (''ssDNA'') have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Isaksson J, Acharya S, Barman J, Cheruku P, Chattopadhyaya J |title=Single-stranded adenine-rich DNA and RNA retain structural characteristics of their respective double-stranded conformations and show directional differences in stacking pattern |journal=Biochemistry |volume=43 |issue=51 |pages=15996–6010 |year=2004 |pmid=15609994 | doi = 10.1021/bi048221v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sense and antisense===
{{Further|[[Sense (molecular biology)]]}}

A DNA sequence is called &quot;sense&quot; if its sequence is the same as that of a [[messenger RNA]] copy that is translated into protein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/misc/DNA.html Designation of the two strands of DNA] JCBN/NC-IUB Newsletter 1989, Accessed 07 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence on the opposite strand is called the &quot;antisense&quot; sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hüttenhofer A, Schattner P, Polacek N |title=Non-coding RNAs: hope or hype? |journal=Trends Genet |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=289–97 |year=2005 |pmid=15851066 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2005.03.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating [[gene expression]] through RNA-RNA base pairing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Munroe S |title=Diversity of antisense regulation in eukaryotes: multiple mechanisms, emerging patterns |journal=J Cell Biochem |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=664–71 |year=2004 |pmid=15389973 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in [[plasmid]]s and [[virus]]es, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Makalowska I, Lin C, Makalowski W |title=Overlapping genes in vertebrate genomes |journal=Comput Biol Chem |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |year=2005 |pmid=15680581 |doi=10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2004.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand. In [[bacteria]], this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnson Z, Chisholm S |title=Properties of overlapping genes are conserved across microbial genomes |journal=Genome Res |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=2268–72 |year=2004 |pmid=15520290 | doi = 10.1101/gr.2433104 |pmc=525685}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lamb R, Horvath C |title=Diversity of coding strategies in influenza viruses |journal=Trends Genet |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=261–6 |year=1991 |pmid=1771674 |doi=10.1016/0168-9525(91)90326-L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercoiling===
{{Further|[[DNA supercoil]]}}
DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called [[DNA supercoil]]ing. With DNA in its &quot;relaxed&quot; state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benham C, Mielke S |title=DNA mechanics |journal= Annu Rev Biomed Eng |volume=7 |pages=21–53 |year=2005 |pmid=16004565 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bioeng.6.062403.132016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by [[enzyme]]s called [[topoisomerase]]s.&lt;ref name=Champoux&gt;{{cite journal |author=Champoux J |title=DNA topoisomerases: structure, function, and mechanism |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=70 |pages=369–413 |year=2001 |pmid=11395412 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.369}}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wang J |title=Cellular roles of DNA topoisomerases: a molecular perspective |journal=Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=430–40 |year=2002 |pmid=12042765 | doi = 10.1038/nrm831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA exists in many possible [[Conformational isomerism|conformations]] that include [[A-DNA]], B-DNA, and [[Z-DNA]] forms, although, only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms.&lt;ref name=Ghosh/&gt; The conformation that DNA adopts depends on the hydration level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of the bases, the type and concentration of metal [[ion]]s, as well as the presence of [[polyamine]]s in solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Basu H, Feuerstein B, Zarling D, Shafer R, Marton L |title=Recognition of Z-RNA and Z-DNA determinants by polyamines in solution: experimental and theoretical studies | journal=J Biomol Struct Dyn |volume=6 |issue=2 | pages=299–309 |year=1988 |pmid=2482766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider right-handed spiral, with a shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove.

===Alternate DNA chemistry===
For a number of years exobiologists have proposed the existence of a [[shadow biosphere]], a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use [[Arsenic DNA|arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA]].

A December 2010 [[NASA]] press conference stated that the [[bacterium]] [[GFAJ-1]], which has evolved in an arsenic-rich environment, is the first terrestrial lifeform found which may have this ability. The bacterium was found in [[Mono Lake]], east of [[Yosemite National Park]]. GFAJ-1 is a [[Rod-shaped bacteria|rod]]-shaped [[extremophile]] bacterium in the family [[Halomonadaceae]] that, when starved of [[phosphorus]], may be capable of incorporating the usually poisonous element [[arsenic]] in its DNA.&lt;ref name='arsenic extremophile'&gt;{{cite news | first = Jason Palmer | title = Arsenic-loving bacteria may help in hunt for alien life | date = December 2, 2010 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11886943 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery may lend weight to the long-standing idea that [[life on other planets|extraterrestrial life]] could have a [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|different chemical makeup]] from life on [[Earth]].&lt;ref name='arsenic extremophile'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Space&gt;{{cite news | last = Bortman | first = Henry | title = Arsenic-Eating Bacteria Opens New Possibilities for Alien Life | date = 2010-12-02 | publisher = Space.com | url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/arsenic-bacteria-alien-life-101202.html | work = [http://www.space.com/ Space.Com web site] | accessdate = 2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research was carried out by a team led by [[Felisa Wolfe-Simon]], a [[geomicrobiologist]] and geobiochemist, a Postdoctoral Fellow of the [[NASA Astrobiology Institute]] with [[Arizona State University]].

===Quadruplex structures===
{{Further|[[G-quadruplex]]}}

At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called [[telomere]]s. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme [[telomerase]], as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes.&lt;ref name=Greider&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greider C, Blackburn E |title=Identification of a specific telomere terminal transferase activity in Tetrahymena extracts | journal=Cell |volume=43 |issue=2 Pt 1 | pages=405–13 |year=1985 |pmid=3907856 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(85)90170-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the [[DNA repair]] systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected.&lt;ref name=Nugent&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nugent C, Lundblad V |title=The telomerase reverse transcriptase: components and regulation | journal=Genes Dev |volume=12 |issue=8 | pages=1073–85 |year=1998 |pmid=9553037 |doi=10.1101/gad.12.8.1073}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|human cells]], telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wright W, Tesmer V, Huffman K, Levene S, Shay J |title=Normal human chromosomes have long G-rich telomeric overhangs at one end | journal=Genes Dev |volume=11 |issue=21 | pages=2801–9 |year=1997 |pmid=9353250 |doi=10.1101/gad.11.21.2801 |pmc=316649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases form a flat plate and these flat four-base units then stack on top of each other, to form a stable ''[[G-quadruplex]]'' structure.&lt;ref name=Burge&gt;{{cite journal |author=Burge S, Parkinson G, Hazel P, Todd A, Neidle S |title=Quadruplex DNA: sequence, topology and structure | journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=34 |issue=19 | pages=5402–15 |year=2006 |pmid=17012276 |pmc=1636468 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl655}}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and [[chelation]] of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Parkinson G, Lee M, Neidle S |title=Crystal structure of parallel quadruplexes from human telomeric DNA | journal=Nature |volume=417 |issue=6891 | pages=876–80 |year=2002 |pmid=12050675 | doi = 10.1038/nature755}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.

In addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Griffith J, Comeau L, Rosenfield S, Stansel R, Bianchi A, Moss H, de Lange T |title=Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop | journal=Cell |volume=97 |issue=4 | pages=503–14 |year=1999 |pmid=10338214 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This [[Triple-stranded DNA|triple-stranded]] structure is called a displacement loop or [[D-loop]].&lt;ref name=Burge/&gt;

===Branched DNA===
{{Further|[[Branched DNA]] and [[DNA nanotechnology]]}}

In DNA [[DNA end#Frayed ends|fraying]] occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seeman NC |title=DNA enables nanoscale control of the structure of matter |journal=Q.

===Base modifications===
{{Further|[[DNA methylation]]}}
The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called [[chromatin]]. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of [[methylation]] of [[cytosine]] bases. For example, cytosine methylation, produces [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]], which is important for [[X-inactivation|X-chromosome inactivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klose R, Bird A |title=Genomic DNA methylation: the mark and its mediators | journal=Trends Biochem Sci |volume=31 |issue=2 | pages=89–97 |year=2006 |pmid=16403636 |doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2005.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average level of methylation varies between organisms – the worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' lacks cytosine methylation, while [[vertebrate]]s have higher levels, with up to 1% of their DNA containing 5-methylcytosine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bird A |title=DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory | journal=Genes Dev |volume=16 |issue=1 | pages=6–21 |year=2002 |pmid=11782440 |doi=10.1101/gad.947102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the importance of 5-methylcytosine, it can [[deamination|deaminate]] to leave a thymine base, so methylated cytosines are particularly prone to [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walsh C, Xu G |title=Cytosine methylation and DNA repair | journal=Curr Top Microbiol Immunol |volume=301 | pages=283–315 |year=2006|pmid=16570853 |doi=10.1007/3-540-31390-7_11 |series=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |isbn=3-540-29114-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other base modifications include adenine methylation in bacteria, the presence of [[5-hydroxymethylcytosine]] in the [[brain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kriaucionis S, Heintz N |title=The nuclear DNA base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is present in Purkinje neurons and the brain |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5929 |pages=929–30 |year=2009 |pmid=19372393 |doi=10.1126/science.1169786|bibcode = 2009Sci...324..929K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[glycosylation]] of uracil to produce the &quot;J-base&quot; in [[kinetoplastid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ratel D, Ravanat J, Berger F, Wion D |title=N6-methyladenine: the other methylated base of DNA | journal=Bioessays |volume=28 |issue=3 | pages=309–15 |year=2006 |pmid=16479578 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20342 |pmc=2754416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gommers-Ampt J, Van Leeuwen F, de Beer A, Vliegenthart J, Dizdaroglu M, Kowalak J, Crain P, Borst P |title=beta-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil: a novel modified base present in the DNA of the parasitic protozoan T. brucei | journal=Cell |volume=75 |issue=6 | pages=1129–36 |year=1993 |pmid=8261512 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(93)90322-H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA can be damaged by many sorts of [[mutagen]]s, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include [[oxidizing agent]]s, [[Alkylation|alkylating agents]] and also high-energy [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[ultraviolet]] light and [[X-ray]]s. The type of DNA damage produced depends on the type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing [[thymine dimer]]s, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Douki T, Reynaud-Angelin A, Cadet J, Sage E |title=Bipyrimidine photoproducts rather than oxidative lesions are the main type of DNA damage involved in the genotoxic effect of solar UVA radiation | journal=Biochemistry |volume=42 |issue=30 | pages=9221–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12885257 | doi = 10.1021/bi034593c}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, oxidants such as [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]] or [[hydrogen peroxide]] produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cadet J, Delatour T, Douki T, Gasparutto D, Pouget J, Ravanat J, Sauvaigo S |title=Hydroxyl radicals and DNA base damage | journal=Mutat Res |volume=424 |issue=1–2 | pages=9–21 |year=1999 |pmid=10064846 |doi=10.1016/S0027-5107(99)00004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beckman KB, Ames BN |title=Oxidative decay of DNA |journal=J.

Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called [[intercalation (chemistry)|''intercalation'']]. Most intercalators are [[aromaticity|aromatic]] and planar molecules; examples include [[ethidium bromide]], [[acridine]]s, [[Daunorubicin|daunomycin]], and [[doxorubicin]]. In order for an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ferguson L, Denny W |title=The genetic toxicology of acridines | journal=Mutat Res |volume=258 |issue=2 | pages=123–60 |year=1991 |pmid=1881402}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, DNA intercalators may be [[carcinogen]]s, and in the case of thalidomide, a [[teratogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stephens T, Bunde C, Fillmore B |title=Mechanism of action in thalidomide teratogenesis |journal=Biochem Pharmacol |volume=59 |issue=12 |pages=1489–99 |year=2000 |pmid=10799645 |doi=10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00388-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others such as [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene diol epoxide]] and [[aflatoxin]] form DNA adducts which induce errors in replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeffrey A |title=DNA modification by chemical carcinogens | journal=Pharmacol Ther |volume=28 |issue=2 | pages=237–72 |year=1985 |pmid=3936066 |doi=10.1016/0163-7258(85)90013-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in [[chemotherapy]] to inhibit rapidly growing [[cancer]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braña M, Cacho M, Gradillas A, de Pascual-Teresa B, Ramos A |title=Intercalators as anticancer drugs | journal=Curr Pharm Des |volume=7 |issue=17 | pages=1745–80 |year=2001 |pmid=11562309 |doi=10.2174/1381612013397113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological functions==
DNA usually occurs as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and circular chromosomes in [[prokaryote]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its [[genome]]; the [[human genome]] has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Venter J |title=The sequence of the human genome | journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5507 | pages=1304–51 |year=2001 |pmid=11181995 |doi=10.1126/science.1058040 |last2=Adams |first2=MD |last3=Myers |first3=EW |last4=Li |first4=PW |last5=Mural |first5=RJ |last6=Sutton |first6=GG |last7=Smith |first7=HO |last8=Yandell |first8=M |last9=Evans |first9=CA|bibcode = 2001Sci...291.1304V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The information carried by DNA is held in the [[DNA sequence|sequence]] of pieces of DNA called [[gene]]s. [[Transmission (genetics)|Transmission]] of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching [[Peptide sequence|protein sequence]] in a process called [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here we focus on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.

===Genes and genomes===
{{Further|[[Cell nucleus]], [[Chromatin]], [[Chromosome]], [[Gene]], [[Noncoding DNA]]}}
Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called [[DNA condensation]] to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the [[cell nucleus]], as well as small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thanbichler M, Wang S, Shapiro L |title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal=J Cell Biochem |volume=96 |issue=3 | pages=506–21 |year=2005 |pmid=15988757 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20519}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]]. A gene is a unit of [[heredity]] and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an [[open reading frame]] that can be transcribed, as well as [[regulatory sequence]]s such as [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s and [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], which control the transcription of the open reading frame.

In many [[species]], only a small fraction of the total sequence of the [[genome]] encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the human genome consists of protein-coding [[exon]]s, with over 50% of human DNA consisting of non-coding [[repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfsberg T, McEntyre J, Schuler G |title=Guide to the draft human genome | journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6822 | pages=824–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11236998 | doi = 10.1038/35057000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the presence of so much [[noncoding DNA]] in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in [[genome size]], or ''[[C-value]]'', among species represent a long-standing puzzle known as the &quot;[[C-value enigma]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregory T |title=The C-value enigma in plants and animals: a review of parallels and an appeal for partnership | journal=Ann Bot (Lond) |volume=95 |issue=1 | pages=133–46 |year=2005 |pmid=15596463 |doi=10.1093/aob/mci009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional [[non-coding RNA]] molecules, which are involved in the [[regulation of gene expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The ENCODE Project Consortium |title=Identification and analysis of functional elements in 1% of the human genome by the ENCODE pilot project |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7146 | pages =799–816 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/nature05874 |pmid=17571346 |pmc=2212820 |bibcode=2007Natur.447..799B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some noncoding DNA sequences play structural roles in chromosomes. [[Telomere]]s and [[centromere]]s typically contain few genes, but are important for the function and stability of chromosomes.&lt;ref name=Nugent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pidoux A, Allshire R |title=The role of heterochromatin in centromere function | pmc=1569473 | journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=360 |issue=1455 | pages=569–79 |year=2005 |pmid=15905142 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2004.1611}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abundant form of noncoding DNA in humans are [[pseudogene]]s, which are copies of genes that have been disabled by mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harrison P, Hegyi H, Balasubramanian S, Luscombe N, Bertone P, Echols N, Johnson T, Gerstein M |title=Molecular Fossils in the Human Genome: Identification and Analysis of the Pseudogenes in Chromosomes 21 and 22 |  journal=Genome Res |volume=12 |issue=2 | pages=272–80 |year=2002 |pmid=11827946 |doi=10.1101/gr.207102 |pmc=155275}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sequences are usually just molecular [[fossil]]s, although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for the creation of new genes through the process of [[gene duplication]] and [[divergent evolution|divergence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harrison P, Gerstein M |title=Studying genomes through the aeons: protein families, pseudogenes and proteome evolution | journal=J Mol Biol |volume=318 |issue=5 | pages=1155–74 |year=2002 |pmid=12083509 |doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(02)00109-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcription and translation===
{{Further|[[Genetic code]], [[Transcription (genetics)]], [[Protein biosynthesis]]}}
A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the [[phenotype]] of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a [[messenger RNA]] sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of [[Translation (biology)|translation]], known collectively as the [[genetic code]]. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called ''codons'' formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).

In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by [[RNA polymerase]]. This RNA copy is then decoded by a [[ribosome]] that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to [[transfer RNA]], which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (&lt;math&gt;4^3&lt;/math&gt; combinations). These encode the twenty [[list of standard amino acids|standard amino acids]], giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA and TAG codons.

[[File:DNA replication en.svg|thumb|450px|right|DNA replication. The double helix is unwound by a [[helicase]] and [[topoisomerase]]. Next, one [[DNA polymerase]] produces the [[Replication fork|leading strand]] copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the [[Replication fork|lagging strand]]. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called [[Okazaki fragment]]s) before [[DNA ligase]] joins them together.]]

===Replication===
{{Further|[[DNA replication]]}}

[[Cell division]] is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]]. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's [[complementary DNA]] sequence is recreated by an [[enzyme]] called [[DNA polymerase]]. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing, and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Albà M |title=Replicative DNA polymerases | journal=Genome Biol |volume=2 |issue=1 | pages=REVIEWS3002 |year=2001 |pmid=11178285 |pmc=150442|doi=10.1186/gb-2001-2-1-reviews3002 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

==Interactions with proteins==
All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These [[protein interactions]] can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.

Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called [[chromatin]]. In eukaryotes this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called [[histone]]s, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sandman K, Pereira S, Reeve J |title=Diversity of prokaryotic chromosomal proteins and the origin of the nucleosome | journal=Cell Mol Life Sci |volume=54 |issue=12 | pages=1350–64 |year=1998 |pmid=9893710 |doi=10.1007/s000180050259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dame RT |title=The role of nucleoid-associated proteins in the organization and compaction of bacterial chromatin |journal=Mol.

These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones making [[ionic bond]]s to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are therefore largely independent of the base sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Luger K, Mäder A, Richmond R, Sargent D, Richmond T |title=Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 A resolution | journal=Nature |volume=389 |issue=6648 | pages=251–60 |year=1997 |pmid=9305837 | doi = 10.1038/38444|bibcode = 1997Natur.389..251L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include [[methylation]], [[phosphorylation]] and [[acetylation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jenuwein T, Allis C |title=Translating the histone code | journal=Science |volume=293 |issue=5532 | pages=1074–80 |year=2001 |pmid=11498575 |doi=10.1126/science.1063127}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chemical changes alter the strength of the interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to [[transcription factor]]s and changing the rate of transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ito T |title=Nucleosome assembly and remodelling | journal=Curr Top Microbiol Immunol |volume=274 | pages=1–22 |pmid=12596902 |year=2003 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-55747-7_1 |series=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |isbn=978-3-540-44208-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas J |title=HMG1 and 2: architectural DNA-binding proteins | journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=29 |issue=Pt 4 | pages=395–401 |year=2001 |pmid=11497996 |doi=10.1042/BST0290395}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grosschedl R, Giese K, Pagel J |title=HMG domain proteins: architectural elements in the assembly of nucleoprotein structures | journal=Trends Genet |volume=10 |issue=3 | pages=94–100 |year=1994 |pmid=8178371 |doi=10.1016/0168-9525(94)90232-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins are the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication [[protein A]] is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination and DNA repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iftode C, Daniely Y, Borowiec J |title=Replication protein A (RPA): the eukaryotic SSB | journal=Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol |volume=34 |issue=3 | pages=141–80 |year=1999 |pmid=10473346 |doi=10.1080/10409239991209255}}&lt;/ref&gt; These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming [[stem-loop]]s or being degraded by [[nuclease]]s.

In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various [[transcription factor]]s, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Myers L, Kornberg R |title=Mediator of transcriptional regulation | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=69 | pages=729–49 |year=2000 |pmid=10966474 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, transcription factors can bind [[enzyme]]s that modify the histones at the promoter; this will change the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spiegelman B, Heinrich R |title=Biological control through regulated transcriptional coactivators | journal=Cell |volume=119 |issue=2 | pages=157–67 |year=2004 |pmid=15479634 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2004.09.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Li Z, Van Calcar S, Qu C, Cavenee W, Zhang M, Ren B |title=A global transcriptional regulatory role for c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=100 |issue=14 | pages=8164–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12808131 |pmc=166200 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1332764100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.8164L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the [[signal transduction]] processes that control responses to environmental changes or [[cellular differentiation]] and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to &quot;read&quot; the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pabo1984&quot; /&gt;

===DNA-modifying enzymes===
====Nucleases and ligases====
[[Nuclease]]s are [[enzyme]]s that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the [[hydrolysis]] of the [[phosphodiester bond]]s. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called [[exonuclease]]s, while [[endonuclease]]s cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in [[molecular biology]] are the [[restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]], which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GAT|ATC-3′ and makes a cut at the vertical line. In nature, these enzymes protect [[bacteria]] against [[Bacteriophage|phage]] infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the [[restriction modification system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bickle T, Krüger D |title=Biology of DNA restriction |pmc=372918 | journal=Microbiol Rev |volume=57 |issue=2 | pages=434–50 |year=1993 |pmid=8336674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in [[molecular cloning]] and [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA fingerprinting]].

Enzymes called [[DNA ligase]]s can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands.&lt;ref name=Doherty&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doherty A, Suh S |title=Structural and mechanistic conservation in DNA ligases | journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=28 |issue=21 | pages=4051–8 |year=2000 |pmid=11058099 |pmc=113121 |doi=10.1093/nar/28.21.4051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligases are particularly important in [[Replication fork|lagging strand]] DNA replication, as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the [[replication fork]] into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in [[DNA repair]] and [[genetic recombination]].&lt;ref name=Doherty/&gt;

====Topoisomerases and helicases====
[[Topoisomerase]]s are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of [[DNA supercoil|supercoiling]] in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break.&lt;ref name=Champoux/&gt; Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schoeffler A, Berger J |title=Recent advances in understanding structure-function relationships in the type II topoisomerase mechanism | journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=33 |issue=Pt 6 | pages=1465–70 |year=2005 |pmid=16246147 |doi=10.1042/BST20051465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt;

[[Helicase]]s are proteins that are a type of [[molecular motor]]. They use the chemical energy in [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s, predominantly [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuteja N, Tuteja R |title=Unraveling DNA helicases. Motif, structure, mechanism and function | doi= 10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04094.x | journal=Eur J Biochem |volume=271 |issue=10 | pages=1849–63 |year=2004 |pmid=15128295}}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.

====Polymerases====
[[Polymerase]]s are [[enzyme]]s that synthesize polynucleotide chains from [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s. The sequence of their products are copies of existing polynucleotide chains – which are called ''templates''. These enzymes function by adding nucleotides onto the 3′ [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl group]] of the previous nucleotide in a DNA strand. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction.&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joyce C, Steitz T |title=Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? |pmc=177480 | journal=J Bacteriol |volume=177 |issue=22 | pages=6321–9 |year=1995 |pmid=7592405}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[active site]] of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.

In DNA replication, a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]] makes a copy of a DNA sequence. Accuracy is vital in this process, so many of these polymerases have a [[Proofreading (Biology)|proofreading]] activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ [[exonuclease]] activity is activated and the incorrect base removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hubscher U, Maga G, Spadari S |title=Eukaryotic DNA polymerases | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=71 | pages=133–63 |year=2002 |pmid=12045093 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.090501.150041}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the [[replisome]] that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the [[DNA clamp]] or [[helicase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnson A, O'Donnell M |title=Cellular DNA replicases: components and dynamics at the replication fork | journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=74 | pages=283–315 |year=2005 |pmid=15952889 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include [[reverse transcriptase]], which is a [[virus|viral]] enzyme involved in the infection of cells by [[retrovirus]]es, and [[telomerase]], which is required for the replication of telomeres.&lt;ref name=Greider/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tarrago-Litvak L, Andréola M, Nevinsky G, Sarih-Cottin L, Litvak S |title=The reverse transcriptase of HIV-1: from enzymology to therapeutic intervention | journal=FASEB J |volume=8 |issue=8 | pages=497–503 |date=1 May 1994|pmid=7514143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure.&lt;ref name=Nugent/&gt;

Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a [[messenger RNA]] transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]], where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, [[RNA polymerase II]], the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large [[protein complex]] with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martinez E |title=Multi-protein complexes in eukaryotic gene transcription | journal=Plant Mol Biol |volume=50 |issue=6 | pages=925–47 |year=2002 |pmid=12516863 |doi=10.1023/A:1021258713850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chromosomal Recombination.svg|thumb|250px|left|Recombination involves the breakage and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two re-arranged chromosomes (C1 and C2).]]

A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called &quot;chromosome territories&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cremer T, Cremer C |title=Chromosome territories, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in mammalian cells | journal=Nat Rev Genet |volume=2 |issue=4 | pages=292–301 |year=2001 |pmid=11283701 | doi = 10.1038/35066075}}&lt;/ref&gt; This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is during [[chromosomal crossover]] when they [[genetic recombination|recombine]]. Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break, swap a section and then rejoin.

Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of [[natural selection]] and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pál C, Papp B, Lercher M |title=An integrated view of protein evolution | journal=Nat Rev Genet |volume=7 |issue=5 | pages=337–48 |year=2006 |pmid=16619049 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Driscoll M, Jeggo P |title=The role of double-strand break repair – insights from human genetics | journal=Nat Rev Genet |volume=7 |issue=1 | pages=45–54 |year=2006 |pmid=16369571 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of chromosomal crossover is [[homologous recombination]], where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce [[chromosomal translocation]]s and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as [[recombinase]]s, such as [[RAD51]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vispé S, Defais M |title=Mammalian Rad51 protein: a RecA homologue with pleiotropic functions |journal=Biochimie |volume=79 |issue=9–10 |pages=587–92 |year=1997 |pmid=9466696 |doi=10.1016/S0300-9084(97)82007-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break either caused by an [[endonuclease]] or damage to the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Neale MJ, Keeney S |title=Clarifying the mechanics of DNA strand exchange in meiotic recombination |journal=Nature |volume=442 |issue=7099 |pages=153–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16838012 | doi = 10.1038/nature04885|bibcode = 2006Natur.442..153N }}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one [[Holliday junction]], in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dickman M, Ingleston S, Sedelnikova S, Rafferty J, Lloyd R, Grasby J, Hornby D |title=The RuvABC resolvasome | journal=Eur J Biochem |volume=269 |issue=22 | pages=5492–501 |year=2002 |pmid=12423347 |doi=10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03250.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
{{Further|[[RNA world hypothesis]]}}
DNA contains the genetic information that allows all modern living things to function, grow and reproduce. However, it is unclear how long in the 4-billion-year [[Timeline of evolution|history of life]] DNA has performed this function, as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material.&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joyce G |title=The antiquity of RNA-based evolution |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=214–21 |year=2002 |pmid=12110897 | doi = 10.1038/418214a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Orgel L |title=Prebiotic chemistry and the origin of the RNA world |journal=Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=99–123 |pmid=15217990 | doi = 10.1080/10409230490460765|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA may have acted as the central part of early [[cell metabolism]] as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out [[catalysis]] as part of [[ribozyme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davenport R |title=Ribozymes. Making copies in the RNA world |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5520 |page=1278 |year=2001 |pmid=11360970 | doi = 10.1126/science.292.5520.1278a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ancient [[RNA world hypothesis|RNA world]] where nucleic acid would have been used for both catalysis and genetics may have influenced the [[evolution]] of the current genetic code based on four nucleotide bases. This would occur, since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Szathmáry E |title=What is the optimum size for the genetic alphabet? |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=89 |issue=7 |pages=2614–8 |year=1992 |pmid=1372984 |doi=10.1073/pnas.89.7.2614|pmc=48712|bibcode = 1992PNAS...89.2614S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible.

===Forensics===
{{Further|[[DNA profiling]]}}

[[Forensic science|Forensic scientists]] can use DNA in [[blood]], [[semen]], [[skin]], [[saliva]] or [[hair]] found at a [[crime scene]] to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as a perpetrator. This process is formally termed [[DNA profiling]], but may also be called &quot;[[genetic fingerprinting]]&quot;. In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as [[short tandem repeat]]s and [[minisatellite]]s, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Collins A, Morton N |title=Likelihood ratios for DNA identification | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=91 |issue=13 | pages=6007–11 |year=1994 |pmid=8016106 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.13.6007|pmc=44126|bibcode = 1994PNAS...91.6007C }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weir B, Triggs C, Starling L, Stowell L, Walsh K, Buckleton J |title=Interpreting DNA mixtures | journal=J Forensic Sci |volume=42 |issue=2 | pages=213–22 |year=1997 |pmid=9068179}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeffreys A, Wilson V, Thein S |title=Individual-specific 'fingerprints' of human DNA | journal=Nature |volume=316 |issue=6023 | pages=76–9 |year=1985|pmid=2989708 |doi=10.1038/316076a0|bibcode = 1985Natur.316...76J }}&lt;/ref&gt; and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 [[Colin Pitchfork|Enderby murders]] case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20061214004903/http://www.forensic.gov.uk/forensic_t/inside/news/list_casefiles.php?case=1 Colin Pitchfork — first murder conviction on DNA evidence also clears the prime suspect] Forensic Science Service Accessed 23 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of forensic science,and the ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva or hair has led to a re-examination of a number of cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was not scientifically possible at the time of the original examination.  Combined with the removal of the [[double jeopardy]] law, this allows cases to be reopened where previous trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury.   People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defence to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has taken place. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.
DNA profiling is also be used to identify victims of mass casualty incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |title=DNA Identification in Mass Fatality Incidents |month=September | year=2006 |publisher=National Institute of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as positively identifying bodies or body parts in serious accidents, DNA profiling is being successfully used to identify individual victims in mass war graves – matching to family members.

Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] suggested what is now accepted as the first correct double-helix model of [[Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids|DNA structure]] in the journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']].&lt;ref name=FWPUB/&gt; Their double-helix, molecular model of DNA was then based on a single [[X-ray diffraction]] image (labeled as &quot;[[Photo 51]]&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;The B-DNA X-ray pattern [http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/sci9.001.5.html on the right of this linked image] was obtained by [[Rosalind Franklin]] and [[Raymond Gosling]] in May 1952 at high hydration levels of DNA and it has been labeled as &quot;Photo 51&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; taken by [[Rosalind Franklin]] and [[Raymond Gosling]] in May 1952, as well as the information that the DNA bases are paired — also obtained through private communications from [[Erwin Chargaff]] in the previous years. [[Chargaff's rules]] played a very important role in establishing double-helix configurations for B-DNA as well as A-DNA.

Experimental evidence supporting the [[Watson and Crick]] model were published in a series of five articles in the same issue of ''Nature''.&lt;ref name=NatureDNA50&gt;Nature Archives [http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/archive.html Double Helix of DNA: 50 Years]&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, Franklin and Gosling's paper was the first publication of their own X-ray diffraction data and original analysis method that partially supported the Watson and Crick model;&lt;ref name=NatFranGos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/franklin-typeBphoto.html |title=Original X-ray diffraction image |publisher=Osulibrary.oregonstate.edu |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; this issue also contained an article on DNA structure by [[Maurice Wilkins]] and two of his colleagues, whose analysis and ''in vivo'' B-DNA X-ray patterns also supported the presence ''in vivo'' of the double-helical DNA configurations as proposed by Crick and Watson for their double-helix molecular model of DNA in the previous two pages of ''Nature''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NatWilk&quot; /&gt; In 1962, after Franklin's death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962] Nobelprize .org Accessed 22 December 06&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nobel rules of the time allowed only living recipients, but a vigorous debate continues on who should receive credit for the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The double helix and the 'wronged heroine' | author= Brenda Maddox| journal= Nature | volume= 421 | pages= 407–408 | date=23 January 2003 | url=http://www.biomath.nyu.edu/index/course/hw_articles/nature4.pdf | pmid=12540909 | doi = 10.1038/nature01399 |format=PDF | issue=6921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the &quot;adaptor hypothesis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crick, F.H.C. [http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/assets/wtx030893.pdf On degenerate templates and the adaptor hypothesis (PDF).] genome.wellcome.ac.uk (Lecture, 1955).

Holley]] and [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg]] to decipher the genetic code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1968/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1968] Nobelprize.org Accessed 22 December 06&lt;/ref&gt; These findings represent the birth of [[molecular biology]].

'''DNA''' was a [[No Wave]] band formed in 1978 by [[guitar]]ist [[Arto Lindsay]] and [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]ist [[Robin Crutchfield]]. Rather than playing their instruments in a traditional manner, they instead focused on making unique and unusual sounds. Their music was described as spare, noisy, and angular and was compared to some of [[Captain Beefheart]]'s output and even to [[Anton Webern]].

==History==
DNA originally consisted of Lindsay, Crutchfield, [[Gordon Stevenson]] and Mirielle Cervenka, and took their name from a song by another no wave band, [[Mars (band)|Mars]].   Stevenson went on to play bass for [[Teenage Jesus and the Jerks]]; Cervenka was the younger sister of [[Exene Cervenka]] of [[X (U.S. band)|X]]. This incarnation of the band was very brief, not playing even one concert.  After the rapid departure of Stevenson and Cervenka, Lindsay and Crutchfield hastily recruited [[Ikue Mori]]—who at the time had little command of English and no drum set—to be DNA's drummer.

This lineup of DNA played occasionally at [[CBGB]] and [[Max's Kansas City]] and recorded one 7&quot; single. Within their first year, they had cemented their reputation as a paradigmatic no wave band when [[Brian Eno]] selected them as one of the four groups documented on the ''[[No New York]]'' LP, the first recording to expose no wave groups to an audience outside of lower [[Manhattan]].  The other three bands appearing on this album were [[James Chance and the Contortions|The Contortions]], [[Teenage Jesus and the Jerks]], and [[Mars (band)|Mars]].

Shortly after the recording of ''[[No New York]]'', Crutchfield left DNA to form a new band, Dark Day. He was replaced by [[Tim Wright (bassist)|Tim Wright]], previously of the [[Cleveland]] band [[Pere Ubu (band)|Pere Ubu]]. As Wright played bass guitar and not keyboards, and was the only member of the band to have any conventional instrumental technique, the change in DNA's sound was dramatic. The music became even more spare and angular, with Wright's bass lines creating a sometimes menacing sound to support Lindsay's scraping, atonal guitar and Mori's irregular rhythms. Their song structures became tighter, briefer, more abstract, and have been compared to [[haiku]].

The Lindsay-Mori-Wright lineup of DNA developed something of a [[cult following]] between 1979 and 1982, but perhaps more of their fans came from the art world than from rock audiences.  Live shows were frequent in this period, but rarely outside of the [[CBGB]]/[[Mudd Club]]/[[Tier 3]] circuit in lower Manhattan.

The group's 10-minute debut album, ''A Taste of DNA'' was recorded for [[Kip Hanrahan]]'s American Clavé label, and was later released on [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] in 1980. Some live DNA tracks appeared on compilation albums while the band was still in existence.

Lindsay, Mori, and Wright decided to dissolve the band in 1982. It's a measure of the cult following the band had developed that its final concerts were three consecutive sold-out nights at CBGB. DNA's final encore was a cover of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s &quot;Whole Lotta Love.&quot; This is not included on the CD ''Last Live at CBGB'', released more than a decade later on [[John Zorn]]'s Avant label.

The band is featured in the film [[Downtown 81]] starring the artist [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]].&lt;ref&gt;McGonigal, Mike: [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_10_38/ai_65071267/ &quot;Same Ol' Samo&quot;], [[ArtForum]], Summer 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

''DNA on DNA'', a comprehensive CD chronicle of the band, was released by No More Records in 2004.

Lindsay and Mori, and to a lesser extent Crutchfield, have remained active in music.  

The rock group [[Blonde Redhead]] takes its name from a DNA song.

After a quiet spell, DNA reappeared with a mix of the [[Loreena McKennitt]] track &quot;[[The Mummers' Dance]]&quot;, which reached #1 on the [[United States|US]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs)|Hot 100 Airplay]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1997.

Batt has worked extensively with [[Goldfrapp]] on ''[[Felt Mountain]]'', ''[[Black Cherry (Goldfrapp album)|Black Cherry]]'', and ''[[Supernature (Goldfrapp album)|Supernature]]''; he also received an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for co-writing &quot;Strict Machine&quot; from ''Black Cherry''.

'''''D.N.A.''''' (previously known as '''''And Then There Was Me''''') is the fourth studio album from American [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] singer [[Mario (entertainer)|Mario Barrett]]. It was released first in the [[United Kingdom]] on October 12, 2009 by [[RCA Records]] and the following day in the US with [[J Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mario2u.com/ |title=The Official Mario Site &amp;#124; The official Mario site |publisher=Mario2u.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the album Mario has worked with previous hitmakers [[Bryan-Michael Cox]] as well as new collaborators including [[The-Dream]], [[Soundz]] and [[Jim Jonsin]] amongst others.

The album's lead single &quot;[[Break Up (song)|Break Up]]&quot; features [[Sean Garrett]] and [[Gucci Mane]]. It was released on April 28, 2009 in the US, peaking at number 2 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Chart]] and 14 on the ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], becoming his most successful single in five years since, &quot;[[Let Me Love You]]&quot;. The second single, &quot;[[Thinkin' About You (Mario song)|Thinkin' About You]]&quot; was released on September 4, 2009.

==Recording and production==
At the end of 2007 Mario told ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' that he had already begun designing the concept for his new album and that production would begin in February 2008. Later in an interview he described this album as World music, an old school R&amp;B influenced with a modern dance pop sound and calling this the &quot;most personal, colossal album of his career&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LIVESTEEZ - Exclusive Interview: Mario Bares It All&quot;&gt;[http://livesteez.com/news/news_detail/1427 LIVESTEEZ: &quot;Interview: Mario Bares It All&quot;] December 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008 a track titled &quot;Emergency Room&quot; leaked to the internet, credited to Mario and featuring Rihanna, and also played by various radio stations throughout the country. Initially people were quick to assume it was [[Rihanna]] on the track, as the studio vocalist [[Priscilla Renea]]'s voice resembled Rihanna's. The song is produced by [[Soundz]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://dyfuse.com/?q=node/6018 DYFUSE: &quot;Emergency Room&quot; track] February 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Also the song's title was especially controversial, because of the situation which [[Rihanna]] is with her boyfriend [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]], which [[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe.com]] has documented extensively. Of the song Mario said &quot;This was a rough cut that I was working on and wanted to present it to Rihanna and her record label. Those aren’t Rihanna’s vocals on the song at all. The record was far from done. I’m still proud of the record but want to make sure that the truth is out there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vibe.com/news/music/2009/02/mario_featuring_rihanna_emergency_room/ Vibe: &quot;Mario feat. Rihanna: &quot;Emergency Room&quot;] February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concept and themes===
Mario described the song &quot;The Hardest Moment&quot; which is set to be on his album as &quot;Personal, because I say things in the record that have multiple meanings. Like the chorus says, &quot;A man that ain't afraid to cry is a man that's not afraid to die.&quot; That to me, even though I'm talking about a relationship in the song, I'm talking about that point in a relationship where everything is over. It's like, you guys are cool, you guys are friends, but you're totally going separate ways. That's probably one of the hardest things a young man and young woman can go through in their relationship. And, so that's what I'm saying in that line. But it also means to me that a strong man is not afraid to be vulnerable, to cry and let it out.&lt;ref name=Twist&gt;{{cite web|title=Twist Chats With Mario!|url=http://twistmagazine.com/2009/03/twist-chats-with-mario-1.html|publisher=Twist Magazine|accessdate=6 February 2011|date=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a previous interview the song &quot;Starlight&quot; produced by [[The-Dream]], Mario has explained the record: &quot;the song is about going after a woman and describes it as dreamy and swaggerized&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LIVESTEEZ - Exclusive Interview: Mario Bares It All&quot;/&gt;

The album was originally scheduled to be released under the title ''And Then There Was Me''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitter.com/MarioSoulTruth/status/2813799426 Twitter: &quot;My album is too Vocally &amp; musically diverse..&quot;] July 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MARIO MIXTAPE|url=http://mario2u.com/news/mario-mixtape|publisher=Mario 2 U|accessdate=6 February 2011|date=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But on January 10, 2009, Mario told Singersroom.com that the album title may change for his effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pellepelle-europe.com |title=Pelle Pelle featuring Mario |publisher=Pellepelle-europe.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to explain what they original title meant he said &quot;''And Then There Was Me'' is more than just me sayin’ my music is fresh, but who I am as a person. That title for me is like, you’ve got the [[Trey Songz]]’, the [[Ne-Yo]]s , and you’ve got the [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]]s of the world—you’ve got all these new artists. This is my fourth album, and some of them aren’t even on their third [album]—I’m coming back with something fresh and new. And then there’s me, there’s Mario.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mario Interview on DjBooth.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://djbooth.net/index/interviews/entry/mario-interview-0604091 |title=Mario Interview on DjBooth.net |publisher=DJBooth |date=Jun 04, 2009|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album title has since changed to &quot;D.N.A&quot; to reflect the musical changes that Mario has gone through since his last album.

==Release and promotion==
Mario was initially unsure of when the album would be released. However, in an interview with Rap-Up.com, he was considering March or April 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mario Eyes March Release For Fourth Album&quot;&gt;[http://rap-up.com/2008/10/30/mario-eyes-march-release-for-fourth-album/ Rap-Up: &quot;Mario Eyes March Release..&quot;] December 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The release date was pushed back to June 2009.&lt;ref name=Exclusive*&gt;[http://bossip.com/86689/exclusive-studio-news-marios-and-then-there-was-me/ Bossip: &quot;Studio News: Mario’s ''And Then There Was Me''&quot;] February 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; But then on Twitter he said &quot;It's getting close &quot;And Then There Was Me&quot; late summer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitter.com/MarioSoulTruth/status/1355822075 Twitter: &quot;It's getting close ''And Then There Was Me''..&quot;] March 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Online retailers, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] later confirmed a September 22, 2009 release date for the project, which later changed again to October 13, 2009 by J Records and Mario's official website, for a United States release. It is Mario's second album to feature a ''Parental Advisory'' warning for strong language, the first being 2007's release of ''[[Go (Mario album)|Go]]''.

In early September 2009, Mario, [[Trey Songz]], [[Day26]] and [[Sean Garrett]] announced on [[106 &amp; Park]] that they will be  all together on a tour with [[RichGirl]] across the [[United States|U.S.]] With 106 &amp; Park supporting the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yuup &amp; R&amp;B Lames on 106 - a Webcam &amp; Vlog video&quot;&gt;[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xad6ab_yuup-rb-lames-on-106_webcam &quot;Yuup &amp; R&amp;B Lames on 106 - a Webcam &amp; Vlog video&quot;] September 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Billboard.com the album debuted this week (Oct.13-20) at No. 9 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, the J Records/RCA Music Group set was released Oct. 13.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mario Breaks Records Billboard.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Mario Goes From 'Break Up' To Breaking Records|url=http://www.billboard.com/features/mario-goes-from-break-up-to-breaking-records-1004030184.story#/features/mario-goes-from-break-up-to-breaking-records-1004030184.story|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=19 January 2011|author=Mariel Concepcion|date=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally the album has not had the warm reception at retail only selling 32,000 copies thus far according to Nielsen Soundscan.&lt;ref name=&quot;m.billboard.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Up for DiscussionPost Comment |url=http://m.billboard.com/features/mario-goes-from-break-up-to-breaking-records-1004030184.story#/features/mario-goes-from-break-up-to-breaking-records-1004030184.story |title=Mario Goes From 'Break Up' To Breaking Records - Billboard Underground &amp;#124; Billboard.com |publisher=M.billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact in its second week on the chart, the album dropped thirty-one spots to #40, further solidifying [[Mario Barrett|Mario]]'s remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/heatseekers-songs#/charts/billboard-200?begin=21&amp;order=position |title=Heatseekers Songs |publisher=Billboard.com |date=1998-12-05 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mario commented on the lackluster sales to Billboard;
&quot;I can't say why I don't get my just due, but it only makes me hungrier,&quot; he says. &quot;I want to continue challenging myself and making incredible music that will connect with fans around the world. I plan to keep creating a distinctive lane for myself. 'D.N.A.,' with the help of 'Break Up,' does just that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;m.billboard.com&quot;/&gt;

Upon its release, ''D.N.A.'' received generally good reviews from most music critics, based on an aggregate score of 73/100 from Metacritic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=D.N.A.: Mario |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/mario/dna |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Capobianco of [[The Boston Globe]] called the album an &quot;unfussy, beautifully sung set&quot; in which &quot;the 23-year-old Mario taps into the tenderness of early [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]]&quot;,&quot; producing &quot;straight-up love songs without histrionics...and Mario’s singing so smooth that Stevie Wonder would approve.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boston Globe review&quot;/&gt; Andrew Rennie of [[Now Magazine]] argues the album is &quot;grown-up, seductive and a little bit explicit (when it needs to be)...it’s a small triumph for guys trying to get in touch with their emotions through the medium of R&amp;B.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Now Toronto Review&quot;/&gt; Mariel Concepcion of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine praised Mario's &quot;representation of desolation&quot; on ''D.N.A.'': &quot;Mario has a broken heart and he's pouring it all out on his latest set.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard review&quot;/&gt; Glenn Gamboa of [[Newsday]] concluded that Mario has now &quot;mastered smooth R&amp;B&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday Review&quot;/&gt; Steve Jones of [[USA Today]] notes, &quot;with each new album, Mario...has grown a little more adventurous artistically.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today review&quot;/&gt; ConcreteLoop.com gave D.N.A. a mostly positive review, stating the album &quot;is refreshingly different in a sea of R&amp;B that tends to sound a little monotonous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Album Review: Mario's DNA|url=http://concreteloop.com/2009/10/album-review-marios-dna|publisher=Concrete Loop|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summation of his album review, Nile Ivey of [[BET]] said ''D.N.A.'' &quot;kept a consistent setting giving the consumer the full on experience on what it’s like for a man to endure a painful separation. Not to say Mario himself went through one, however, he did a hell of a job convincing us he did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BET Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ivey|first=Nile|title=Album Review: Mario|url=http://www.bet.com/Music/reviews/Mariodna_albumreview_10.20.09.htm|publisher=[[Black Entertainment Television]]|accessdate=6 February 2011|date=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the reviews were mostly positive, there were a few criticisms leveled at ''D.N.A.''. Andy Kellman of [[AllMusic]] laments, &quot;while it will please the majority of the fan base, the material does not allow Mario -- a vocalist more versatile than many would like to admit -- to do much more than toggle between a Lothario and a softie.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;About.com review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellman |first=Andy |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1636900|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( D.N.A. &gt; Overview ))) |publisher=allmusic |date=2009-10-10 |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikael Wood of [[Entertainment Weekly]] called Mario &quot;forgettable&quot; in his mixed review of the album, arguing: &quot;lack of personality doesn't kill the disc's ample pleasures. It just makes you wonder whose D.N.A. we're examining.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EW Review&quot;/&gt; DJBooth.Net was left believing that ''D.N.A.'' represents Mario &quot;expanding as a musician, but not necessarily evolving.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DjBooth.net&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="796">'''DNA Oy''' is a Finnish on telecommunications company. It was born in [[2007]] after a merger. DNA offers [[cellular phone]] services, [[ADSL]], [[cable television]] and regular telephone service.

DNA was originally founded as the cell phone operator of the ''Finnet'' group of current and former [[telephone cooperative]]s after there was a splitup in the association. The Helsinki Telephone Association (now [[Elisa Oyj]]) left Finnet and they needed to found an own operator, which they did in [[2000]]. In [[2006]] there began to be new difficulties between the remaining Finnet companies. The largest members merged themselves with DNA and left the association.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44482">{{For|a non-technical introduction to genetics in general|Introduction to genetics}}
{{genetic genealogy}}
A '''genealogical DNA test''' examines the [[nucleotide]]s at specific locations on a person's [[DNA]] for [[genetic genealogy]] purposes. The test results are not meant to have any informative medical value and do not determine specific genetic diseases or disorders (see possible exceptions in ''[[#Medical information|Medical information]]'' below); they are intended only to give genealogical information. Genealogical DNA tests generally involve comparing the results of living individuals to historic populations.

==Procedure==
[[File:Cotton-Swab-Cheek-090105-N-5681S-008.jpg|right|thumb|Hospital Corpsman 1st Class uses a swab to take a DNA sample from a Fireman aboard USS Iwo Jima (LHD 7)]]
The general procedure for taking a genealogical DNA test involves taking a painless cheek-scraping (also known as a buccal swab) at home and mailing the sample to a genetic genealogy laboratory for testing. Some laboratories use [[mouth wash]] or [[chewing gum]] instead of cheek swabs. Some laboratories, such as the [http://hogl.arl.arizona.edu Human Origins Genotyping Laboratory (HOGL)] at the [[University of Arizona]], offer to store DNA samples for ease of future testing. All United States laboratories will destroy the DNA sample upon request by the customer, guaranteeing that a sample is not available for further analysis.

==Types of tests==
The most popular ancestry tests are Y chromosome ([[Y-DNA]]) testing and mitochondrial DNA ([[mtDNA]]) testing, which test direct-line paternal and maternal ancestry, respectively. DNA tests for other purposes attempt, for example, to determine a person's comprehensive genetic make-up and/or [[Ethnicity|ethnic origins]].

==Y chromosome (Y-DNA) testing== &lt;!-- a redirect target for links from other articles --&gt;
A man's [[patrilineal]] ancestry, or male-line ancestry, can be traced using the DNA on his [[Y chromosome]] (Y-DNA) through [[Y-STR]] testing. This is useful because the Y chromosome passes down almost unchanged from father to son, i.e., the non-recombining and sex-determining regions of the Y chromosome do not change. A man's test results are compared to another man's results to determine the time frame in which the two individuals shared a [[most recent common ancestor]] or MRCA. If their test results are a perfect, or nearly perfect match, they are related within genealogy's time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smgf.org/pages/yinterpretation.jspx |title=Y-DNA matches |publisher=Smgf.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each person can then look at the other's father-line information, typically the names of each patrilineal ancestor and his spouse, together with the dates and places of their marriage and of both spouses' births and deaths. This information table will be referred to again within the [[mtDNA testing]] section below as the (matrilineal) &quot;information table&quot;. The two matched persons may find a common ancestor or MRCA, as well as whatever information the other already has about their joint patrilineal ancestry prior to the MRCA—which might be a big help to one of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jswdna/adamsresults.html |title=Here is one such case, see the heading &quot;A success story quote&quot; |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or if not, both keep trying to extend their patrilineal ancestry further back in time. Each may choose to have their test results included in their [[surname]]'s &quot;[[Surname DNA project]]&quot;. And each receives the other's contact information if the other chose to allow this. They may correspond, and may work together in the future on joint research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dna-testing-adviser.com/FamilyTrees.html |title=Extending Family Trees with DNA Testing |publisher=Dna-testing-adviser.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who wish to determine their direct paternal DNA ancestry can ask their father, brother, paternal uncle, paternal grandfather, or a cousin who shares a common patrilineal ancestry (the same Y-DNA) to take a test for them.

===What gets tested===
Y-DNA testing involves looking at [[Y-STR|STR]] segments of DNA on the Y chromosome. The STR segments which are examined are referred to as [[genetic marker]]s and occur in what is considered [[Noncoding DNA|&quot;junk&quot; DNA]].

====STR markers====
A Y-chromosome contains sequences of repeating nucleotides known as [[short tandem repeat]]s (STRs). The number of repetitions varies from one person to another and a particular number of repetitions is known as an [[allele]] of the marker. Individual Y-DNA sequences or STRs which have proved useful in genealogical DNA work are called markers, and each has a name, such as DYS393 in the following example. (Names are assigned by the [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee]], and DYS means '''Y'''-'''D'''NA unique '''S'''equence [or '''S'''egment] while 393 is this sequence's unique identification number – its identifier.)&lt;ref&gt;ftdna.com (kept uptodate). http://www.familytreedna.com/faq/answers/default.aspx?faqid=9#961 &quot;FAQ: What do the DYS ...  STR names mean?&quot; Retrieved 2012-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt; This example states that the allele of Rumpelstiltskin's DYS393 marker is 12, also called the marker's &quot;value&quot;. The value 12 means the DYS393 sequence of nucleotides is repeated 12 times—with a DNA sequence of (AGAT)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.

====SNP markers====
[[Image:dna-SNP.svg|thumb|250px|Strand 1 differs from strand 2 at a single base pair location (a C &amp;rarr; T polymorphism).]]
A [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) is a change to a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence. The relative mutation rate for an SNP is extremely low. This makes them ideal for marking the history of the human genetic tree. SNPs are named with a letter code and a number. The letter indicates the lab or research team that discovered the SNP. The number indicates the order in which it was discovered. For example, M173 is the 173rd SNP documented by the Human Population Genetics Laboratory at [[Stanford University]], which uses the letter M.

===Understanding test results===
Y-DNA tests generally examine 10-67 STR markers on the Y chromosome, but over 100 markers are available. STR test results provide the personal [[haplotype]]. SNP results indicate the [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|haplogroup]].

===Haplotype===
{{see|Y-chromosome haplogroups by populations}}
A Y-DNA [[haplotype]] is the numbered results of a genealogical Y-DNA test. Each [[allele]] value has a distinctive frequency within a population. For example, at [[List of Y-STR markers|DYS455]], the results will show 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 repeats, with 11 being most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ybase.org/statistics.asp |title=Ybase statistics |publisher=Ybase.org |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For high marker tests the [[allele]] frequencies provide a signature for a [[Patrilineality|surname lineage]].

The test results are then compared to another [[Surname project|project]] member's results to determine the time frame in which the two people shared a [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA). If the two tests match perfectly on 
111 markers for members with the same surname, there is a 50% probability that the MRCA was fewer than 2 generations ago, 90% probability that it was fewer than 4 generations ago, and 95% probability it was fewer than 5 generations ago.&lt;ref name=match111&gt;ftdna.com (kept uptodate). http://www.familytreedna.com/faq/answers/default.aspx?faqid=9#925 &quot;FAQ: ...how should the genetic distance at 111 Y-chromosome STR markers be interpreted?&quot; Retrieved 2012-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before choosing a test, it is important for an individual to check the number of markers that will be tested. For example, the [[Genographic Project]] looks at only 12 markers, while most laboratories and [[surname project]]s recommend testing at least 25. The more markers that are tested, the more discriminating and powerful the results will be. A 12-marker STR test is usually not discriminating enough to provide conclusive results for a common surname.

STRs results may also indicate a likely [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|haplogroup]], though this can only be confirmed by specifically testing for that Haplogroups' [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs).

===Haplogroup===
[[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Haplogroups]] are large groups of [[haplotype]]s that can be used to define genetic populations and are often geographically oriented.
{{Y-DNA}}
Y-DNA haplogroups are determined by [[single nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] tests.  SNPs are locations on the DNA where one nucleotide has &quot;mutated&quot; or &quot;switched&quot; to a different nucleotide.  The nucleotide switch must occur in at least 1% of the population to be considered a useful SNP.  If it occurs in less than 1% of the population, it is considered a personal (or private) SNP.

====Haplogroup prediction====
A person's haplogroup can often be inferred from their haplotype, but can be proven only with a Y-chromosome SNP tests (Y-SNP test). In addition, some companies offer sub-clade tests, such as for [[Haplogroup G (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup G]].
For example, Haplogroup G has a known modal haplotype:

Few haplotypes will exactly match the modal values for Haplogroup G. One can consult an [[allele frequency]] table to determine the likelihood of remaining in Haplogroup G based on the variations observed.

Additional predictions include:
*If DYS426 is 12 and DYS392 is 11, one is probably a member of haplogroup R1a1.
*If DYS426 is 12 and DYS392 is not 11, one is probably a member of haplogroup R1b.
*If DYS426 is 11, one is probably a member of haplogroup G,I, or J.
*If DYS426 is 11 and DYS388 is 12, one is in the known modal haplotype for G shown above.

A [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayes classifier]] to predict the haplogroup probabilities for an observed haplotype is available on the web: [http://www.hprg.com/hapest5/ Whit Athey Haplogroup Predictor].

==Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing== &lt;!-- a redirect target for links from other articles --&gt;

Africa, the center of the start of the migration, is at the top left and South America is at the far right.]]

A person's matrilineal or mother-line ancestry can be traced using the DNA in his or her [[mitochondria]], the [[mtDNA]], as follows: This mtDNA is passed down by the mother unchanged, to all children. If a perfect match is found to another person's mtDNA test results, one may find a common ancestor in the other relative's (matrilineal) &quot;information table&quot;, similar to the patrilineal or [[Y-DNA testing]] case above. However, because mtDNA mutations are very rare, a ''nearly'' perfect match is not as helpful as it is for the above patrilineal case. In the matrilineal case, it takes a perfect match to be very helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smgf.org/pages/mt_interpretation.jspx |title=mtDNA matches |publisher=Smgf.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that, in cultures lacking [[matrilineal surnames]] to pass down, neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or Y-DNA case: for further information on this difficulty in ''traditional genealogy'', due to lack of ''matrilineal'' surnames (or matrinames), see [[Matriname]].&lt;ref name=Sykes&gt;Sykes, Bryan (2001). ''The Seven Daughters of Eve''. W. W. Norton. ISBN 0-393-02018_5, pp. 291-92. Sykes discusses the difficulty in genealogically tracing a maternal lineage, due to the lack of matrilineal surnames (or matrinames).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people cite [[paternal mtDNA transmission]] as invalidating mtDNA testing,&lt;ref&gt;for example: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/mv5812037q10u886/ M. Pickford, &quot;Paradise lost: Mitochondrial eve refuted&quot;], SpringerLink, July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; but this has not been found problematic in genealogical DNA testing, nor in scholarly [[population genetics]] studies. See the rest of this article.

===What gets tested===
mtDNA by current conventions is divided into three regions. They are the coding region (00577-16023) and two [[Hyper Variable Region]]s (HVR1 [16024-16569], and HVR2 [00001-00576]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phylotree.org/rCRS_annotated.htm |title=mtDNA regions |publisher=Phylotree.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; All test results are compared to the mtDNA of a [[Europe]]an in [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|Haplogroup H2a2a]]. This early sample is known as the [[Cambridge Reference Sequence]] (CRS). A list of [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) is returned. The relatively few &quot;mutations&quot; or &quot;transitions&quot; that are found are then reported simply as differences from the CRS, such as in the examples just below.

The two most common mtDNA tests are a sequence of HVR1 and a sequence of both HVR1 and HVR2. Some mtDNA tests may only analyze a partial range in these regions. Some people are now choosing to have a full sequence performed, to maximize their genealogical help. The full sequence is still somewhat controversial because it may reveal medical information.

===Understanding test results===
The most basic of mtDNA tests will sequence [[Hyper Variable Region]] 1 (HVR1). HVR1 [[nucleotide]]s are numbered 16024-16569.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phylotree.org/rCRS_annotated.htm |title=mtDNA HVR1 region |publisher=Phylotree.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Examples:
* Some test reports might omit the &quot;16&quot; (16nnn) prefix from HVR1 results, i.e. 519C and not 16519C.

===Haplogroup===
Most results include a prediction of [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups|mtDNA Haplogroup]].
{{mtDNA}}
If you belong to a Haplogroup that is distantly related to the CRS, then the prediction may be sufficient. Some companies test for specific mutations in the coding region. For large Haplogroups, such as mtDNA [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|Haplogroup H]], an extended test is offered to assign a sub-clade.

==Geographic origin tests==
Autosomal tests that test the recombining chromosomes are available. These attempt to measure an individual's mixed geographic heritage by identifying particular markers, called ancestry informative markers or AIM, that are associated with populations of specific geographical areas. The tests' [[validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] have been called into question but they continue to be popular.&lt;ref&gt;Bolnick, DA et al. [http://dirkschweitzer.net/E3b-papers/Science-0710-Bolnick-1.pdf The Science and Business of Genetic Ancestry Testing.] ''Science'': Vol 318, 19 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frudakis, T. [http://hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/race%20and%20population%20genetics/Frudakis-LegitAncestryTests_Science2008.pdf The Legitimacy of Genetic Ancestry Tests.] ''Science'': Vol 319, 22 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Anomalous findings most often result from databases too small to associate markers with all the areas where they occur in indigenous populations.

===Biogeographical ancestry===
[[Autosome|Autosomal DNA]] testing purports either to determine the &quot;genetic percentages&quot; of a person's  ancestry from particular continents/regions or to identify the countries and &quot;tribes&quot; of origin on an overall basis. ''Admixture'' tests arrive at these percentages by examining [[single nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]], which are locations on the DNA where one nucleotide has &quot;mutated&quot; or &quot;switched&quot; to a different nucleotide. Tests' listing geographical places of origin use alleles—individual and family variations on various chromosomes across the genome analyzed with the aid of population databases. As further detailed below, this latter type of test concentrates on standard identity markers, such as the [[CODIS]] profile, combined with databases such as OmniPop, ENFSI and proprietary adaptations of published studies.

====STR tests====
In 2006, one company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaconsultants.com |title=DNA Testing Systems |publisher=Dnaconsultants.com |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an [[autosomal]] [[DNA]] ancestry-tracing product that combined the traditional CODIS markers used by law enforcement officers and the judicial system with OmniPop, a population database developed by San Diego detective Brian Burritt. Customers received matches to their profile's frequency of occurrence in world populations, as well as a breakout for European ancestry based on the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.str-base.org/ |title=ENFSI DNA WG - STR Population Database |publisher=str-base.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a public service, the company has supported the expansion of OmniPop, which currently encompasses over 360 populations, double that of its first release. The ENFSI calculator uses data from 24 [[European ethnic groups|European]] populations (5700 profiles). The two databases must be searched separately, because they are based on two different sets of markers. The company sells its product as the DNA Fingerprint Test. The 16 markers incorporated in its results are: D8S1179, D21S11, D7S820, CSFIPO, D3S1358, THO1, D13S317, D16S539, D2S1338, D19S433, VWA, TPOX, D18S51, D5S818, and FGA.

The theory behind using a [[forensic]] profile for ancestry tracing is that the alleles' respective frequency of occurrence develops over generations with equal input of the two parents, since for each location we take one value from our mother and one from our father. It thus serves as a window into a person's total ancestral composition. The configuration of scores reflects inherited changes from all previous generations in all ancestral lines, and can predict an individual's unique probable ethnic matches based on the profile's frequency or rarity in different populations.&lt;ref&gt;Balding, D.J. et al., eds. (2001). ''Handbook of Statistical Genetics'', New York:  Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

As studies from more populations are included, the accuracy of results should improve, leading to a more informative picture of one's ancestry.

Along the same lines, yet another company&lt;ref&gt;DNA Tribes&lt;/ref&gt; identifies the indigenous and diaspora populations in which an individual's autosomal STR profile is most common. This test examines autosomal [[short tandem repeat|STRs]], which are locations on a chromosome where a pattern of two or more nucleotides is repeated and the repetitions are directly adjacent to each other. The populations in which the individual's profile is most common are identified and assigned a likelihood score. The individual's profile is assigned a likelihood of membership in each of thirty-four world regions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnatribes.com/sample-results/dnatribes-global-survey-regional-affinities.pdf |title=Neighbor joining tree illustrating the relationships among world regions based on Euclidean distance |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[STR analysis]] measures the frequency of a person's DNA profile within major world regions. Unlike SNP admixture tests, this analysis is based on objectively identified world regions and does not depend on any system of presumed biogeographic classifications. As most STR analysis examines markers chosen for their high intra-group variation, the utility of these particular STR markers to access inter-group relationships may be greatly diminished.

====SNP tests====
The same company also provides since 2011 a geographical &quot;deep ancestry&quot; analysis that can be performed based on genotype raw data from any of several SNP microarray tests. The report includes both admixture and total similarity comparisons of one's DNA to world genetic structure. The report identifies ancestral contributions to one's genome from 7 continental zones (European, Middle Eastern, Sub‐Saharan African, East Asian, North Asian, South Asian, Native American) as well as from  20 world regions (Atlantic European, Caucasus‐Anatolian, Arabian, North African, Baltic-Urals, South India, Indus Valley, African Great Lakes, West African, Southern African, Horn of Africa, Southeast Asian, Chinese, Manchurian, Siberian, Arctic, Mongolian, Oceanian, Mesoamerican, ).

==United States==
Because of its history of immigration, slavery, and significant indigenous peoples, people of the United States have been interested in using genealogical DNA studies to help them learn more about their ancestry.

===United States - Native American ancestry===
{{see|Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}
Autosomal testing, Y-DNA, and mtDNA testing can be conducted to determine [[Native Americans in the United States|Amerindian]] ancestry. A mitochondrial Haplogroup determination test based on mutations in [[Hypervariable Region]] 1 and 2 may establish whether a person's direct female line belongs to one of the canonical Native American Haplogroups, [[Haplogroup A (mtDNA)|A]], [[Haplogroup B (mtDNA)|B]], [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|C]], [[Haplogroup D (mtDNA)|D]] or [[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)|X]]. If one's DNA belonged to one of those groups, the implication would be that he or she is, in whole or part, Native American.

As political entities, tribes have established their own requirements for membership, often based on at least one of a person's ancestors having been included on tribal-specific Native American censuses (or final rolls) prepared during [[treaty]]-making, relocation to [[Indian reservation|reservations]] or apportionment of land in the late 19th century and early 20th century. One example is the [[Dawes Rolls]]. In addition, the U.S. government does not consider DNA as admissible evidence for enrollment in any [[Native Americans in the United States|federally recognized tribe]] or reception of benefits. Tribes are political constructs, not genetic populations.

The vast majority of Native American individuals do belong to one of the five identified [[mtDNA]] [[Haplogroup]]s. Many Americans are just discovering they have some percentage of Native ancestry. Some attempt to validate their heritage with the goal of gaining admittance into a tribe, but most tribes do not use DNA results in that way. These tests may be useful for [[Adoption|adoptees]] to discover Native American ancestry.

===United States - African ancestry===
Y-DNA and mtDNA testing may be able to determine with which peoples in present-day [[Africa]]n country a person shares a direct line of part of his or her ancestry, but patterns of historic migration and historical events cloud the tracing of ancestral groups. Testing company African Ancestry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanancestry.com/ |title=African Ancestry |publisher=African Ancestry |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintains an &quot;African Lineage Database&quot; of African lineages from 30 countries and over 160 ethnic groups. Due to joint long histories in the US, approximately 30% of [[African American]] males have a European [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y chromosome haplogroup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanancestry.com/patriclan.html |title=Patriclan: Trace Your Paternal Ancestry |publisher=African Ancestry |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 58% of African Americans have the equivalent of one great-grandparent (12.5 percent) of European ancestry. Only about 5% have the equivalent of one great-grandparent of Native American ancestry. By the early 19th century, substantial families of Free Persons of Color had been established in the Chesapeake Bay area who were descended from people free during the colonial period; most of those have been documented as descended from white men and African women (servant, slave or free). Over time various groups married more within mixed-race, black or white communities.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/], accessed 15 Feb 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to authorities like Salas, nearly three-quarters of the ancestors of African Americans taken in [[History of slavery in the United States|slavery]] came from regions of West Africa. The African-American movement to discover and identify with ancestral tribes has burgeoned since DNA testing became available. Often members of African-American churches take the test as groups.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} African Americans cannot easily trace their ancestry during the years of slavery through [[Surname project|surname research]], [[census]] and property records, and other traditional means. Genealogical DNA testing may provide a tie to regional African heritage.

===United States - Melungeon testing===
{{Main|Melungeon#DNA testing}}
[[Melungeon]]s are one of numerous multiracial groups in the United States with origins wrapped in myth. The historical research of Paul Heinegg has documented that many of the groups in the Upper South were descended from mixed-race people who were free in colonial Virginia and descended from unions between the Europeans and Africans. They moved to the frontiers of Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee to gain some freedom from the racial barriers of the plantation areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], accessed 15 Feb 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Several efforts, including a number of ongoing studies, have examined the genetic makeup of families historically identified as [[Melungeon]]. Most results point primarily to a mixture of European and African, which is supported by historical documentation. Some may have a very small amount of Native American lineages (none in one study). Though some companies provide additional Melungeon research materials with Y-DNA and mtDNA tests, any test will allow comparisons with the results of current and past Melungeon DNA studies.

==General interest==
===Cohanim ancestry===
{{Main|Y-chromosomal Aaron}}
The [[Kohen|Cohanim]] (or Kohanim) is a [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] priestly line of descent in [[Judaism]]. According to the [[Torah|Bible]], the ancestor of the Cohanim is [[Aaron]], brother of [[Moses]]. Many believe that descent from Aaron is verifiable with a Y-DNA test: the first published study in genealogical Y chromosome DNA testing found that a significant percentage of Cohens had distinctively similar DNA, rather more so than general Jewish or Middle Eastern populations. These Cohens tended to belong to [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup J]], with Y-STR values clustered unusually closely around a haplotype known as the [[Cohen Modal Haplotype]] (CMH). This could be consistent with a shared common ancestor, or with the hereditary priesthood having originally been founded from members of a single closely related clan.

Nevertheless, the original studies tested only six Y-STR markers, which is considered a low-resolution test. Such a test does not have the resolution to prove relatedness, nor to estimate reliably the time to a common ancestor. The Cohen Modal Haplotype (CMH), while notably frequent among Cohens, also appears in the general populations of haplogroups [[Haplogroup J1 (Y-DNA)|J1]] and [[Haplogroup J2 (Y-DNA)|J2]] with no particular link to the Cohen ancestry. So while many Cohens have haplotypes close to the CMH, many more of such haplotypes worldwide belong to people with no likely Cohen connection at all. According to researchers (Hammer), it is only the CMH that is found in J1 that is to be attributed to the Aaron lineage, not the CMH in J2.  Jews with the CMH in both J1 and J2 cannot all be descended from one man who lived approximately 3,300 years ago, because J1 diverged from J2 10,000 years ago.

Resolution may be increased by the testing of more than six Y-STR markers. For some, this could help to establish relatedness to particular recent Cohen clusters. For many, the testing is unlikely to distinguish definitively shared Cohen ancestry from that of the more general population distribution. So far no published research indicates what extended Y-STR haplotype distributions appear to be characteristic of Cohens.

Although some high-resolution testing has been done, to date the results have not been released.

===European testing===
{{See|Genetic history of Europe}}
For people with [[Europe]]an maternal ancestry, mtDNA tests are offered to determine which of eight European maternal &quot;clans&quot; the direct-line maternal ancestor belonged to. This  mtDNA haplotype test was popularized in the book ''[[The Seven Daughters of Eve]]''.

SNP testing may enable mostly European individuals to determine to which Sub-European population they belong:
*Northern European subgroup (NOR) - mostly Northern and Southwestern European
*Southeastern European (Mediterranean) subgroup (MED) - mostly Southeastern Europeans (Greeks, Albanians or Turks)
*Middle Eastern subgroup (MIDEAS) - mostly Middle Eastern
*South Asian subgroup (SA) - mostly South Asian from the Indian sub-continent (i.e. Indian)

===Hindu testing===
The 49 established ''[[gotra]]s'' are clans or families whose members trace their descent to a common ancestor, usually a [[Wise old man|sage]] of ancient times. The gotra proclaims a person's identity and a &quot;gotraspeak&quot; is required to be presented at [[Hindu]] ceremonies. People of the same gotra are not allowed to marry.

One company says it can use a 37-marker Y-DNA test to &quot;verify genetic relatedness and historical gotra genealogies for [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] engagements, marriages and business partnerships.&quot; This has not been supported by independent research. Any Y-DNA test can be used to compare results with another person whose gotra is known.

==Benefits==
{{Main|Genetic genealogy}}
Genealogical DNA tests have become popular due to the ease of testing at home and their supplementing [[genealogy|genealogical research]]. Genealogical DNA tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy whether he or she is related to another person within a certain time frame, or with certainty that he or she is not related. DNA tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. But, they are limited by restrictions on lines which may be studied. The civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals who provided or wrote the information.

The aforementioned [[Y-DNA testing]] results are normally stated as probabilities: For example, with the same surname a perfect 37/37 marker test match gives a 95% likelihood of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) being within 8 generations,&lt;ref&gt;ftdna.com (kept uptodate). http://www.familytreedna.com/faq/answers/default.aspx?faqid=9#922 &quot;FAQ: ...how should the genetic distance at 37 Y-chromosome STR markers be interpreted?&quot; Retrieved 2012-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt; while a 111 of 111 marker match gives the same 95% likelihood of the MRCA being within only 5 generations back.&lt;ref name=match111/&gt;

As presented above in [[mtDNA testing]], if a perfect match is found, the mtDNA test results can be  helpful. In some cases, research according to traditional genealogy methods encounters difficulties due to the lack of regularly recorded matrilineal surname information in many cultures.(see [[Matrilineal surname]]).&lt;ref name=Sykes /&gt;

==Drawbacks==
Common concerns about genealogical DNA test are cost and privacy issues (some testing companies retain samples and results for their own use without a privacy agreement with subjects). The most common complaint from DNA test customers is the failure of the company to make results understandable to them.

DNA tests can do some things well, but there are constraints.  Testing of the Y-DNA lineage from father to son may reveal complications, due to unusual mutations, secret adoptions, and false paternity (i.e. the father in one generation is not the father in birth records.) According to some genomics experts, autosomal tests may have a margin of error up to 15% and blind spots.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Some users have recommended that there be government or other regulation of ancestry testing to ensure more standardization.&lt;ref&gt;Lee et al., &quot;The Illusive Gold Standard in Genetic Ancestry Testing&quot;, ''Science'' 3, July 2009: 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical information==
Though genealogical DNA test results generally have no informative medical value and are not intended to determine genetic diseases or disorders, a correlation exists between a lack of [[List of Y-STR markers#DYS464|DYS464]] markers and [[infertility]], and between [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|mtDNA haplogroup H]] and protection from [[sepsis]]. Certain haplogroups have been linked to longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10463944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The testing of full mtDNA sequences is still somewhat controversial as it may reveal medical information. The field of linkage disequilibrium, unequal association of genetic disorders with a certain mitochondrial lineage, is in its infancy, but those mitochondrial mutations that have been linked are searchable in the genome database Mitomap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitomap.org |title=Mitomap |publisher=Mitomap |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Human Genome Research Institute operates the Genetic And Rare Disease Information Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genome.gov/10000409 |title=Genetic And Rare Disease Information Center (GARD) |publisher=Genome.gov |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can assist consumers in identifying an appropriate [[Genetic testing|screening test]] and help locate a nearby medical center that offers such.

==DNA in genealogy software==
Some [[Comparison of genealogy software|genealogy]] software programs now allow recording DNA marker test results, allowing for tracking of both Y-chromosome and mtDNA tests, and recording results for relatives. DNA-family tree wall charts are available.

A '''DNA [[polymerase]]''' is an [[enzyme]] that helps [[catalyze]] in the [[polymerization]] of [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s into a [[DNA]] strand. DNA polymerases are best known for their [[Negative feedback|feedback role]] in [[DNA replication]], in which the polymerase &quot;reads&quot; an intact DNA strand as a [[wikt:template|template]] and uses it to synthesize the new strand. This process copies a piece of DNA. The newly polymerized molecule is complementary to the template strand and identical to the template's original partner strand. DNA polymerases use [[magnesium]] ions as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]].  Human DNA polymerases are 900-1000 amino acids long.

==Function==
[[Image:DNA polymerase.svg|thumb|200px|right|DNA polymerase with proofreading ability]]
DNA polymerase can add free nucleotides to only the 3' end of the newly forming strand. This results in elongation of the new strand in a [[5'-3']] direction. No known DNA polymerase is able to begin a new chain (''de novo''). DNA polymerase can add a nucleotide onto only a preexisting 3'-[[hydroxide|OH group]], and, therefore, needs a [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]] at which it can add the first nucleotide. Primers consist of [[RNA]] and/or DNA bases. In DNA replication, the first two bases are always RNA, and are synthesized by another enzyme called [[primase]]. An enzyme known as a [[helicase]] is required to unwind DNA from a double-strand structure to a single-strand structure to facilitate replication of each strand consistent with the [[semiconservative]] model of DNA replication. 

Error correction is a property of some, but not all, DNA polymerases. This process corrects mistakes in newly synthesized DNA. When an incorrect base pair is recognized, DNA polymerase reverses its direction by one base pair of DNA. The 3'-5' [[exonuclease]] activity of the enzyme allows the incorrect base pair to be excised (this activity is known as ''[[proofreading (biology)|proofreading]]''). Following base excision, the polymerase can re-insert the correct base and replication can continue.

Various DNA polymerases are extensively used in molecular biology experiments.

==Variation across species==
DNA polymerases have highly conserved structure, which means that their overall catalytic subunits vary, on a whole, very little from species to species. Conserved structures usually indicate important, irreplaceable functions of the cell, the maintenance of which provides evolutionary advantages. 

Some viruses also encode special DNA polymerases, such as [[Hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase]]. These may selectively replicate viral DNA through a variety of mechanisms. [[Retroviruses]] encode an unusual DNA polymerase called [[reverse transcriptase]], which is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp). It polymerizes DNA from a template of [[RNA]].

Based on sequence homology, DNA polymerases can be further subdivided into seven different families: A, B, C, D, X, Y, and RT. 

===Family A===
Polymerases contain both replicative and repair polymerases. Replicative members from this family include the extensively studied [[T7 DNA polymerase]], as well as the eukaryotic mitochondrial DNA Polymerase γ. Among the repair polymerases are ''Escherichia coli'' DNA pol I, ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]'' pol I, and ''[[Bacillus stearothermophilus]]'' pol I.  These repair polymerases are involved in excision repair and processing of [[Okazaki fragment]]s generated during lagging strand synthesis.

===Family B===
B family polymerases are involved in DNA repair and replication. These include; Pol II (bacterial), Pol B (archaebacterial), and Pol α, δ, and ε (eukaryotic). Pol ζ another B family polymerase, is made of two subunits Rev3 and Rev7 and is involved in translesion synthesis. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend primers with terminal mismatches.

===Family C===
Polymerases are the primary bacterial chromosomal replicative enzymes. DNA Polymerase III alpha subunit from ''E. coli'' is the catalytic subunit &lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.028}} &lt;/ref&gt; and possesses no known nuclease activity. A separate subunit, the epsilon subunit, possesses the 3'-5' exonuclease activity used for editing during chromosomal replication. Recent research has classified Family C polymerases as a subcategory of Family X{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}.

===Family D===
Polymerases are still not very well characterized. All known examples are found in the [[Euryarchaeota]] subdomain of Archaea and are thought to be replicative polymerases.

===Family X===

Contains the well-known eukaryotic polymerase pol β, as well as other eukaryotic polymerases such as pol σ, pol λ, pol μ, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Pol β is required for short-patch [[base excision repair]], a DNA repair pathway that is essential for repairing alkylated or oxidised bases as well as [[abasic site]]s.  Pol λ and Pol μ are involved in [[non-homologous end-joining]], a mechanism for rejoining DNA double-strand breaks.  TdT is expressed only in lymphoid tissue, and adds &quot;n nucleotides&quot; to double-strand breaks formed during [[V(D)J recombination]] to promote immunological diversity.  The yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' has only one Pol X polymerase, [[Pol IV]], which is involved in [[non-homologous end-joining]].

===Family Y===
Y Polymerases differ from others in having a low fidelity on undamaged templates and in their ability to replicate through damaged DNA, known as [[DNA repair #Translesion synthesis|translesion synthesis]] (TLS). Members of this family are hence called translesion synthesis polymerases. Depending on the lesion, TLS polymerases can bypass the damage in an error-free or error-prone fashion, the latter resulting in elevated mutagenesis. [[Xeroderma pigmentosum]] variant (XPV) patients for instance have mutations in the gene encoding [[DNA polymerase eta|Pol η (eta)]], which is error-free for UV-lesions. In XPV patients, alternative error-prone polymerases, e.g., Pol ζ (zeta) (polymerase ζ is a B Family polymerase a complex of the catalytic subunit [[REV3L]] with [[Rev7]], which associates with [[REV1|Rev1]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Gan GN; Wittschieben JP; Wittschieben BØ; Wood RD | date= 2008 | title=DNA polymerase zeta (pol zeta) in higher eukaryotes| journal = Cell Research | volume = 18| page= 174–83 | pmid= 18157155| issue=1| doi=10.1038/cr.2007.117| pages=174–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;), are thought to be involved in mistakes that result in the cancer predisposition of these patients. Other members in humans are [[POLI|Pol ι (iota)]], Pol κ (kappa), and [[REV1|Rev1]] (terminal deoxycytidyl transferase). In ''E. coli'', two TLS polymerases, Pol IV (DINB) and [[Pol V]] (UmuD'&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C), are known.

===Family RT===
Some viruses also encode special DNA polymerases, such as Hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase. These may selectively replicate viral DNA through a variety of mechanisms. Retroviruses encode an unusual DNA polymerase called reverse transcriptase, which is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp). It polymerizes DNA from a template of RNA.
The reverse transcriptase family contains examples from both retroviruses and eukaryotic polymerases. The eukaryotic polymerases are usually restricted to [[telomerase]]s. These polymerases use an RNA template to synthesize the DNA strand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17930">'''DNA computing''' is a form of [[computing]] which uses [[DNA]], [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]], instead of the traditional silicon-based [[computer]] [[technology|technologies]]. DNA computing, or, more generally, [[Biocomputers|biomolecular computing]], is a fast developing interdisciplinary area. Research and development in this area concerns theory, experiments and applications of DNA computing.

== History ==
This field was initially developed by [[Leonard Adleman]] of the [[University of Southern California]], in [[1994]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1126/science.7973651}} &amp;mdash; The first DNA computing paper. Describes a solution for the directed [[Hamiltonian path problem]]. Also aviable here: http://www.usc.edu/dept/molecular-science/papers/fp-sci94.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;  Adleman demonstrated a [[proof-of-concept]] use of DNA as a form of computation which solved the seven-point [[Hamiltonian path problem]]. Since the initial Adleman experiments, advances have been made and various [[Turing machine]]s have been proven to be constructible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/S0166-218X(96)00058-3}} &amp;mdash; Describes a solution for the [[boolean satisfiability problem]]. Also aviable here: http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~kempe/TEACHING/SEMINAR-LENS-SPRING08/boneh95DNAcomputational.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

While the initial interest was in using this novel approach to tackle [[NP-hard]] problems, it was soon realized that they may not be best suited for this type of computation, and several proposal have been made to find a &quot;[[killer application]]&quot; for this approach. In 1997 computer scientist [[Mitsunori Ogihara]] working with biologist Animesh Ray suggested one to be the evaluation of [[Boolean circuit]]s and described an implementation. &lt;ref&gt;M. Ogihara and A. Ray, [http://wwwcp.tphys.uni-heidelberg.de/comp-phys/handouts/Boolean2.pdf &quot;Simulating Boolean circuits on a DNA computer&quot;].
Algorithmica 25:239–250, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/052197dna.html &quot;In Just a Few Drops, A Breakthrough in Computing&quot;], ''[[New York Times]]'', May 21, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, researchers from the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in Rehovot, Israel, unveiled a programmable molecular computing machine composed of enzymes and DNA molecules instead of silicon microchips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/02/0224_030224_DNAcomputer.html |title=Computer Made from DNA and Enzymes |accessdate=2009-11-26 |last=Lovgren |first=Stefan |date=2003-02-24 |work=National Geographic }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 28, 2004, [[Ehud Shapiro]], Yaakov Benenson, Binyamin Gil, Uri Ben-Dor, and Rivka Adar at the [[Weizmann Institute]] announced in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] that they had constructed a DNA computer coupled with an input and output module which would theoretically be capable of diagnosing [[cancer]]ous activity within a cell, and releasing an anti-cancer drug upon diagnosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;shapiro_cancer&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1038/nature02551}}. Also aviable here: http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~udi/papers/automoleculcomp_nat04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capabilities ==

DNA computing is fundamentally similar to [[parallel computing]] in that it takes advantage of the many different molecules of DNA to try many different possibilities at once.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite doi | 10.1109/5992.998634}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  

DNA computing also offers much lower power consumption than traditional silicon computers. DNA uses [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) as fuel to allow ligation or as a means to heat the strand to cause disassociation.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite doi|10.1147/rd.176.0525}} [http://domino.watson.ibm.com/tchjr/journalindex.nsf/0/271e50a130854b0785256bfa006841c9?OpenDocument Link]. Also aviable here: http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/bennett1973.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; Both strand hybridization and the hydrolysis of the DNA backbone can occur spontaneously, powered by the potential energy stored in DNA. Consumption of two ATP molecules releases 1.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; J. Even with a large number of transitions per second using two ATP molecules, power output is still low. For instance, Kahan reports 109 transitions per second with an energy consumption of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; W,&lt;ref name=&quot;kahan08&quot;&gt;
{{cite doi |10.1016/j.physd.2008.01.027}}. Also aviable here: http://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/labs/bwn/nanos/papers/Towards_molecular_computers_that_operate_in_a_biological_environment.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly Shapiro reports a system producing 7.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; outputs in 4000 sec resulting in an energy consumption rate of ~10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; W.&lt;ref name=&quot;shapiro&quot;/&gt;

For certain specialized problems, DNA computers are faster and smaller than any other computer built so far. Furthermore, particular mathematical computations have been demonstrated to work on a DNA computer. As an example, Aran Nayebi&lt;ref name=&quot;nayebi09&quot;&gt;
{{cite journal
 | date = [[2009]]

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; has provided a general implementation of [[Strassen algorithm | Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm]] on a DNA computer, although there are problems with scaling.

But DNA computing does not provide any new capabilities from the standpoint of [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]], the study of which problems are computationally solvable using different models of computation.
For example,
if the space required for the solution of a problem grows exponentially with the size of the problem ([[EXPSPACE]] problems) on [[von Neumann architecture|von Neumann machines]], it still grows exponentially with the size of the problem on DNA machines.
For very large EXPSPACE problems, the amount of DNA required is too large to be practical.
([[Quantum computing]], on the other hand, ''does'' provide some interesting new capabilities.)

DNA computing overlaps with, but is distinct from, [[DNA nanotechnology]].  The latter uses the specificity of Watson-Crick [[Base pair|basepairing]] and other DNA properties to make novel structures out of DNA.  These structures can be used for DNA computing, but they do not have to be. Additionally, DNA computing can be done without using the types of molecules made possible by DNA nanotechnology.

The Caltech researchers have created a circuit made from 130 unique DNA strands, which is able to calculate the square root of numbers up to 15.&lt;ref&gt;[[Science News]][http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/330621/title/Flexible_DNA_computer_finds_square_roots_ Flexbile DNA computer finds square roots] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

There are multiple methods for building a computing device based on DNA, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Most of these build the basic logic gates ([[Logical AND|AND]], [[Logical OR|OR]], [[Logical NOT|NOT]]) associated with [[digital logic]] from a DNA basis. Some of the different bases include DNAzymes, [[oligonucleotide|deoxyoligonucleotides]], enzymes, DNA tiling, and [[polymerase chain reaction]].

===DNAzymes===

Catalytic DNA ([[deoxyribozyme]] or DNAzyme) catalyze a reaction when interacting with the appropriate input, such as a matching [[oligonucleotide]]. These DNAzymes are used to build logic gates analogous to digital logic in silicon; however, DNAzymes are limited to 1-, 2-, and 3-input gates with no current implementation for evaluating statements in series.

The DNAzyme logic gate changes its structure when it binds to a matching oligonucleotide and the fluorogenic substrate it is bonded to is cleaved free. While other materials can be used, most models use a fluorescence-based substrate because it is very easy to detect, even at the single molecule limit.&lt;ref name=&quot;weiss&quot;&gt;
{{cite doi | 10.1126/science.283.5408.1676}}. Also aviable here: http://www.lps.ens.fr/~vincent/smb/PDF/weiss-1.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of fluorescence can then be measured to tell whether or not a reaction took place. The DNAzyme that changes is then “used,” and cannot initiate any more reactions. Because of this, these reactions take place in a device such as a continuous stirred-tank reactor, where old product is removed and new molecules added. 

Two commonly used DNAzymes are named E6 and 8-17. These are popular because they allow cleaving of a substrate in any arbitrary location.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite doi | 10.1073/pnas.94.9.4262}}. Also aviable here: http://www.pnas.org/content/94/9/4262.full.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; Stojanovic and MacDonald have used the E6 DNAzymes to build the [[MAYA I]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite doi | 10.1038/nbt862}}. Also aviable here: http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/cps296.6/current/papers/SS03.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MAYA II]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite doi |10.1021/nl0620684}}. Also aviable here: http://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/labs/bwn/nanos/papers/Medium_Scale_Integration_of_Molecular.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; machines, respectively; Stojanovic has also demonstrated logic gates using the 8-17 DNAzyme.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite doi | 10.1021/ja016756v}}. Also aviable at http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/stojanovic_mitchell_stefanovic2002.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; While these DNAzymes have been demonstrated to be useful for constructing logic gates, they are limited by the need for a metal cofactor to function, such as Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and thus are not useful [[in vivo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;weiss&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite doi|10.1016/j.chembiol.2003.12.012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A design called a ''stem loop'', consisting of a single strand of DNA which has a loop at an end, are a dynamic structure that opens and closes when a piece of DNA bonds to the loop part. This effect has been exploited to create several [[logic gate]]s.  These logic gates have been used to create the computers MAYA I and [[MAYA II]] which can play [[tic-tac-toe]] to some extent.&lt;!--

===Enzymes===

Enzyme based DNA computers are usually of the form of a simple [[Turing machine]]; there is analogous hardware, in the form of an enzyme, and software, in the form of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | first = Ehud

&lt;/ref&gt;

Benenson, Shapiro and colleagues have demonstrated a DNA computer using the [[FokI]] enzyme&lt;ref name=&quot;shapiro&quot;&gt;
{{cite  doi | 10.1038/35106533}}. Also aviable here: http://www.technion.ac.il/~keinanj/pub/110.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded on their work by going on to show automata that diagnose and react to [[prostate cancer]]: under expression of the genes [[PPAP2B]] and [[GSTP1]] and an over expression of [[PIM1]] and [[HPN]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shapiro_cancer&quot; /&gt; Their automata evaluated the expression of each gene, one gene at a time, and on positive diagnosis then released a single strand DNA molecule (ssDNA) that is an antisense for [[MDM2]]. MDM2 is a repressor of [[p53|protein 53]], which itself is a tumor suppressor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite doi | 10.2174/1568009053332627}}
&lt;/ref&gt; On negative diagnosis it was decided to release a suppressor of the positive diagnosis drug instead of doing nothing. A limitation of this implementation is that two separate automata are required, one to administer each drug. The entire process of evaluation until drug release took around an hour to complete. This method also requires transition molecules as well as the FokI enzyme to be present. The requirement for the FokI enzyme limits application ''in vivo'', at least for use in “cells of higher organisms”.&lt;ref name=&quot;kahan08&quot;/&gt; It should also be pointed out that the 'software' molecules can be reused in this case.

=== Toehold exchange ===

DNA computers have also been constructed using the concept of toehold exchange.  In this system, an input DNA strand binds to a [[sticky end]], or toehold, on another DNA molecule, which allows it to displace another strand segment from the molecule.  This allows the creation of modular logic components such as AND, OR, and NOT gates and signal amplifiers, which can be linked into arbitrarily large computers.  This class of DNA computers does not require enzymes or any chemical capability of the DNA.&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1132493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Algorithmic self-assembly ===

[[Image:Rothemund-DNA-SierpinskiGasket.jpg|thumb|300px|DNA arrays that display a representation of the [[Sierpinski gasket]] on their surfaces. Click the image for further details.  Image from Rothemund ''et al.'', 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;rothemund04winfree&quot;/&gt;]]

{{main|DNA nanotechnology#Algorithmic self-assembly|l1=DNA nanotechnology: Algorithmic self-assembly}}

DNA nanotechnology has been applied to the related field of DNA computing.  DNA tiles can be designed to contain multiple sticky ends with sequences chosen so that they act as [[Wang tile]]s.  A DX array has been demonstrated whose assembly encodes an [[Exclusive or|XOR]] operation; this allows the DNA array to implement a [[cellular automaton]] which generates a [[fractal]] called the [[Sierpinski gasket]].  This shows that computation can be incorporated into the assembly of DNA arrays, increasing its scope beyond simple periodic arrays.&lt;!--

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17276">[[Image:RNA-codons.png|thumb|A series of codons in part of a [[mRNA]] molecule. Each codon consists of three [[nucleotide]]s, usually representing a single [[amino acid]].]]
The '''sequence''' or '''primary structure of a nucleic acid''' is the composition of atoms that make up the [[nucleic acid]] and the [[chemical bond]]s that bond those atoms.  Because nucleic acids, such as [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], are unbranched polymers, this specification is equivalent to specifying the sequence of [[nucleotide]]s that comprise the molecule.  This sequence is written as a succession of letters representing a real or hypothetical nucleic acid molecule or strand.  By convention, the primary structure of a DNA or RNA molecule is reported from the 5' end to the 3' end.

The sequence has capacity to represent [[information]]. Biological DNA represents the information which directs the functions of a living thing. In that context, the term '''genetic sequence''' is often used.  Sequences can be read from the biological raw material through [[DNA sequencing]] methods.

Nucleic acids also have a [[secondary structure]] and [[tertiary structure]]. Primary structure is sometimes mistakenly referred to as ''primary sequence''. Conversely, there is no parallel concept of secondary or tertiary sequence.

{{Main|Nucleotide}}

Nucleic acids consist of a chain of linked units called nucleotides.  Each nucleotide consists of three subunits: a [[phosphate]] group and a [[sugar]] ([[ribose]] in the case of [[RNA]], [[deoxyribose]] in [[DNA]]) make up the backbone of the nucleic acid strand, and attached to the sugar is one of a set of [[nucleobase]]s.  The nucleobases are important in [[base pair]]ing of strands to form higher-level [[Nucleic acid secondary structure|secondary]] and [[Nucleic acid tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] such as the famed [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]].

The possible letters are ''A'', ''C'', ''G'', and ''T'', representing the four [[nucleotide]] [[nucleobase|bases]] of a DNA strand &amp;mdash; [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], [[thymine]] &amp;mdash; [[covalent]]ly linked to a [[phosphodiester bond|phosphodiester]] backbone. In the typical case, the sequences are printed abutting one another without gaps, as in the sequence AAAGTCTGAC, read left to right in the [[Directionality (molecular biology)|5' to 3']] direction. With regards to [[transcription (biology)|transcription]], a sequence is on the coding strand if it has the same order as the transcribed RNA.

One sequence can be [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to another sequence, meaning that they have the base on each position is the complementary (i.e. A to T, C to G) and in the reverse order. For example, the complementary sequence to TTAC is GTAA. If one strand of the double-stranded DNA is considered the [[sense (molecular biology)|sense]] strand, then the other strand, considered the antisense strand, will have the complementary sequence to the sense strand.

=== Notation ===

{{Main|Nucleic acid notation}}

While A, T, C, and G represent a particular nucleotide at a position, there are also letters that represent ambiguity which are used when more than one kind of nucleotide could occur at that position. The rules of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ([[IUPAC]]) are as follows:&lt;ref name=NCIUB&gt;[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/misc/naseq.html Nomenclature for Incompletely Specified Bases in Nucleic Acid Sequences], NC-IUB, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A''' = adenine
*'''C''' = cytosine
*'''G''' = guanine
*'''T''' = thymine
*'''R''' = G A (purine)
*'''Y''' = T C (pyrimidine)
*'''K''' = G T (keto)
*'''M''' = A C (amino)
*'''S''' = G C (strong bonds)
*'''W''' = A T (weak bonds)
*'''B''' = G T C (all but A)
*'''D''' = G A T (all but C)
*'''H''' = A C T (all but G)
*'''V''' = G C A (all but T)
*'''N''' = A G C T (any)

These symbols are also valid for RNA, except with U (uracil) replacing T (thymine).&lt;ref name=NCIUB/&gt;

Apart from adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T) and uracil (U), DNA and RNA also contain bases that have been modified after the nucleic acid chain has been formed. In DNA, the most common modified base is 5-methylcytidine (m5C). In RNA, there are many modified bases, including pseudouridine (Ψ), dihydrouridine (D), inosine (I), ribothymidine (rT) and [[7-methylguanosine]] (m7G).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mun.ca/biology/desmid/brian/BIOL2060/BIOL2060-22/CB22.html BIOL2060: Translation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biogeo.uw.edu.pl/research/grupaC_en.html Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hypoxanthine]] and [[xanthine]] are two of the many bases created through [[mutagen]] presence, both of them through deamination (replacement of the amine-group with a carbonyl-group). Hypoxanthine is produced from [[adenine]], xanthine from [[guanine]].&lt;ref&gt;T Nguyen, D Brunson, C L Crespi, B W Penman, J S Wishnok, and S R Tannenbaum, [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=48797 DNA damage and mutation in human cells exposed to nitric oxide in vitro], Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 April 1; 89(7): 3030–3034&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, deamination of [[cytosine]] results in [[uracil]].

== Biological significance ==

[[File:Kooditabel.png|200px|thumb|A depiction of the [[genetic code]], by which the information contained in [[nucleic acid]]s are [[Translation (genetics)|translated]] into [[amino acid]] sequences in [[protein]]s.]]

{{See|Genetic code|Central dogma of molecular biology}}

In biological systems, nucleic acids contain information which is used by a living [[Cell (biology)|cell]] to construct specific [[protein]]s.  The sequence of [[nucleobase]]s on a nucleic acid strand is [[Translation (genetics)|translated]] by cell machinery into a sequence of [[amino acid]]s making up a protein strand.  Each group of three bases, called a [[codon]], corresponds to a single amino acid, and there is a specific [[genetic code]] by which each possible combination of three bases corresponds to a specific amino acid.

The [[central dogma of molecular biology]] outlines the mechanism by which proteins are constructed using information contained in nucleic acids.  [[DNA]] is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into [[mRNA]] molecules, which travels to the [[ribosome]] where the mRNA is used as a template for the construction of the protein strand.  Since nucleic acids can bind to molecules with [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] sequences, there is a distinction between &quot;[[Sense (molecular biology)|sense]]&quot; sequences which code for proteins, and the complementary &quot;antisense&quot; sequence which is by itself nonfunctional, but can bind to the sense strand.

== Sequence determination ==

[[Image:DNA sequence.svg|right|thumb|268px|Electropherogram printout from automated sequencer for determining part of a DNA sequence]]

{{Main|DNA sequencing}}

DNA sequencing is the process of determining the [[nucleotide]] sequence of a given [[DNA]] fragment. The sequence of the DNA of a living thing encodes the necessary information for that living thing to survive and reproduce. Therefore, determining the sequence is useful in fundamental research into why and how organisms live, as well as in applied subjects. Because of the importance of DNA to living things, knowledge of a DNA sequence may be useful in practically any biological [[research]]. For example, in [[medicine]] it can be used to identify, [[diagnosis|diagnose]] and potentially develop [[treatment (medicine)|treatments]] for [[genetic disease]]s. Similarly, research into [[pathogens]] may lead to treatments for contagious diseases. [[Biotechnology]] is a burgeoning discipline, with the potential for many useful products and services.

RNA is not sequenced directly. Instead, it is copied to a DNA by [[reverse transcriptase]], and this DNA is then sequenced.

Current sequencing methods rely on the discriminatory ability of DNA polymerases, and therefore can only distinguish four bases. An inosine (created from adenosine during [[RNA editing]]) is read as a G, and 5-methyl-cytosine (created from cytosine by [[DNA methylation]]) is read as a C.  With current technology, it is difficult to sequence small amounts of DNA, as the signal is too weak to measure. This is overcome by [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) amplification.

===Digital representation===
[[File:AMY1gene.png|thumb|370px|Genetic sequence in digital format.]]
Once a nucleic acid sequence has been obtained from an organism, it is stored ''[[in silico]]'' in digital format. Digital genetic sequences may be stored in [[sequence database]]s, be analyzed (see ''Sequence analysis'' below), be digitally altered and/or be used as templates for creating new actual DNA using [[artificial gene synthesis]].

== Sequence analysis ==

{{Main|Sequence analysis}}

Digital genetic sequences may be analyzed using the tools of [[bioinformatics]] to attempt to determine its function.

=== Genetic testing ===

{{Main|Genetic testing}}

The DNA in an organism's [[genome]] can be analyzed to [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]] vulnerabilities to inherited [[disease]]s, and can also be used to determine a child's paternity (genetic father) or a person's [[ancestry]]. Normally, every person carries two variations of every [[gene]], one inherited from their mother, the other inherited from their father. The [[human genome]] is believed to contain around 20,000 - 25,000 genes. In addition to studying [[chromosome]]s to the level of individual genes, genetic testing in a broader sense includes [[biochemical]] tests for the possible presence of [[genetic disease]]s, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders.

Genetic testing identifies changes in chromosomes, genes, or proteins.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting&lt;/ref&gt;   Usually, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder. Several hundred genetic tests are currently in use, and more are being developed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/genetictesting.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogentest.org/patient/public_health/info/public/unit3/DefinitionsGeneticTesting-3rdDraf18Jan07.xhtml |title=Definitions of Genetic Testing |accessdate=2008-08-10 |work=Definitions of Genetic Testing (Jorge Sequeiros and Bárbara Guimarães) |publisher=EuroGentest Network of Excellence Project |date=2008-09-11 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sequence alignment ===

{{Main|Sequence alignment}}

In bioinformatics, a '''sequence alignment''' is a way of arranging the sequences of [[DNA]], [[RNA]], or [[protein]] to identify regions of similarity that may be due to functional, [[structural biology|structural]], or [[evolution]]ary relationships between the sequences.&lt;ref name=mount&gt;{{cite book| author=Mount DM.| year=2004 | title=Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis |edition=2nd | publisher= Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: Cold Spring Harbor, NY. |isbn=0-87969-608-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;    If two sequences in an alignment share a common ancestor, mismatches can be interpreted as [[point mutation]]s and gaps as insertion or deletion mutations ([[indel]]s) introduced in one or both lineages in the time since they diverged from one another. In sequence alignments of proteins, the degree of similarity between [[amino acid]]s occupying a particular position in the sequence can be interpreted as a rough measure of how [[conservation (genetics)|conserved]] a particular region or [[sequence motif]] is among lineages. The absence of substitutions, or the presence of only very conservative substitutions (that is, the substitution of amino acids whose [[side chain]]s have similar biochemical properties) in a particular region of the sequence, suggest&lt;ref name=predict&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11337480 Ng PC, Henikoff S. Predicting deleterious amino acid substitutions. Genome Res. 2001 May;11(5):863-74.]&lt;/ref&gt; that this region has structural or functional importance. Although DNA and RNA [[nucleotide]] bases are more similar to each other than are amino acids, the conservation of base pairs can indicate a similar functional or structural role.

[[Computational phylogenetics]] makes extensive use of sequence alignments in the construction and interpretation of [[phylogenetic tree]]s, which are used to classify the evolutionary relationships between homologous genes represented in the genomes of divergent species. The degree to which sequences in a query set differ is qualitatively related to the sequences' evolutionary distance from one another. Roughly speaking, high sequence identity suggests that the sequences in question have a comparatively young [[most recent common ancestor]], while low identity suggests that the divergence is more ancient. This approximation, which reflects the &quot;[[molecular clock]]&quot; hypothesis that a roughly constant rate of evolutionary change can be used to extrapolate the elapsed time since two genes first diverged (that is, the [[coalescence (genetics)|coalescence]] time), assumes that the effects of mutation and [[natural selection|selection]] are constant across sequence lineages. Therefore it does not account for possible difference among organisms or species in the rates of [[DNA repair]] or the possible functional conservation of specific regions in a sequence. (In the case of nucleotide sequences, the molecular clock hypothesis in its most basic form also discounts the difference in acceptance rates between [[silent mutation]]s that do not alter the meaning of a given [[codon]] and other mutations that result in a different [[amino acid]] being incorporated into the protein.) More statistically accurate methods allow the evolutionary rate on each branch of the phylogenetic tree to vary, thus producing better estimates of coalescence times for genes.

'''DNA profiling''' (also called '''DNA testing''', '''DNA typing''', or '''genetic fingerprinting''') is a technique employed by [[forensic scientist]]s to assist in the identification of individuals  by their respective [[DNA]] profiles. '''DNA profiles''' are encrypted sets of numbers that reflect a person's DNA makeup, which can also be used as the person's identifier. DNA profiling should not be confused with [[full genome sequencing]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kijk'' magazine, 01 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in, for example, [[parental testing]] and [[criminal investigation]].

Although 99.9% of human DNA sequences are the same in every person, enough of the DNA is different to distinguish one individual from another, unless they are monozygotic twins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lander&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BA/Use_of_DNA_Identification.php |title=Use of DNA in Identification |publisher=Accessexcellence.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA profiling uses repetitive (&quot;repeat&quot;) sequences that are highly variable,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lander&quot;/&gt; called [[variable number tandem repeats]] (VNTRs), particularly short tandem repeats ([[Short tandem repeat|STRs]]). VNTR [[locus (genetics)|loci]] are very similar between closely related humans, but so variable that unrelated individuals are extremely unlikely to have the same VNTRs.

The DNA profiling technique was first reported in 1984&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Wambaugh, ''The Blooding'' (New York: A Perigord Press Book, 1989), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; by Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]] at the [[University of Leicester]] in England,&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys A.J., Wilson V., Thein S.W. (1984). [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v314/n6006/abs/314067a0.html &quot;Hypervariable 'minisatellite' regions in human DNA&quot;]. Nature 314: 67–73. {{doi|10.1038/314067a0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now the basis of several [[national DNA database]]s. Dr. Jeffreys's genetic fingerprinting was made commercially available in 1987, when a chemical company, [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI), started a blood-testing centre in England.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Wambaugh, ''The Blooding'' (New York: A Perigord Press Book, 1989), 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA profiling process==

The process begins with a sample of an individual's DNA (typically called a &quot;reference sample&quot;). The most desirable method of collecting a reference sample is the use of a [[buccal swab]], as this reduces the possibility of contamination. When this is not available (e.g. because a court order may be needed and not obtainable) other methods may need to be used to collect a sample of [[blood]], [[saliva]], [[semen]], or other appropriate fluid or tissue from personal items (e.g. toothbrush, razor, etc.) or from stored samples (e.g. banked [[spermatozoon|sperm]] or [[biopsy]] tissue). Samples obtained from blood relatives (biological relative) can provide an indication of an individual's profile, as could human remains which had been previously profiled.

A reference sample is then analyzed to create the individual's DNA profile using one of a number of techniques, discussed below. The DNA profile is then compared against another sample to determine whether there is a genetic match.

[[Image:D1S80Demo.gif|thumb|right|350px|&lt;center&gt;Variations of [[VNTR]] allele lengths in 6 individuals.&lt;/center&gt;]]

===RFLP analysis===
{{Main|Restriction fragment length polymorphism}}

The first methods for finding out genetics used for DNA profiling involved [[restriction enzyme]] digestion, followed by [[Southern blot]] analysis. Although [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s can exist in the restriction enzyme cleavage sites, more commonly the enzymes and DNA probes were used to analyze VNTR loci. However, the Southern blot technique is laborious, and requires large amounts of undegraded sample DNA. Also, Karl Brown's original technique looked at many [[minisatellite]] loci at the same time, increasing the observed variability, but making it hard to discern individual [[allele]]s (and thereby precluding [[parental testing]]). These early techniques have been supplanted by [[PCR]]-based assays.

===PCR analysis===
{{Main|polymerase chain reaction}}

With the invention of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique, DNA profiling took huge strides forward in both discriminating power and the ability to recover information from very small (or degraded) starting samples. PCR greatly amplifies the amounts of a specific region of DNA, using [[oligonucleotide]] [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] and a [[Taq polymerase|thermostable DNA polymerase]]. Early assays such as the [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]]-[[HLA-DQA1|DQ alpha]] [[Allele specific oligonucleotide|reverse]] [[dot blot]] strips grew to be very popular due to their ease of use, and the speed with which a result could be obtained. However they were not as discriminating as [[RFLP]]. It was also difficult to determine a DNA profile for mixed samples, such as a [[vaginal swab]] from a [[sexual assault]] victim.
Fortunately, the PCR method was readily adaptable for analyzing [[VNTR]], particularly [[Short tandem repeat|STR]] loci.

===STR analysis===
{{Main|Short tandem repeats}}
The method of DNA profiling used today is based on PCR and uses short tandem repeats (STR) a type of [[VNTR]]. This method uses highly polymorphic regions that have short repeated sequences of DNA (the most common is 4 bases repeated, but there are other lengths in use, including 3 and 5 bases). Because unrelated people almost certainly have different numbers of repeat units, STRs can be used to discriminate between unrelated individuals. These STR [[locus (genetics)|loci]] (locations on a chromosome) are targeted with sequence-specific primers and amplified using [[PCR]]. The DNA fragments that result are then separated and detected using [[electrophoresis]]. There are two common methods of separation and detection, [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) and [[gel electrophoresis]].

Each STR is polymorphic, but the number of alleles is very small. Typically each STR allele will be shared by around 5 - 20% of individuals. The power of STR analysis comes from looking at multiple STR loci simultaneously. The pattern of alleles can identify an individual quite accurately. Thus STR analysis provides an excellent identification tool. The more STR regions that are tested in an individual the more discriminating the test becomes.

From country to country, different STR-based DNA-profiling systems are in use. In North America, systems which amplify the [[CODIS]] 13 core loci are almost universal, while in the UK the [[SGM+]] 10 loci system (which is compatible with The [[National DNA Database]]), is in use. Whichever system is used, many of the STR regions used are the same. These DNA-profiling systems are based on multiplex reactions, whereby many STR regions will be tested at the same time.

The true power of [[STR analysis]] is in its statistical power of discrimination. Because the 13 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are [[independent assortment|independently assorted]] (having a certain number of repeats at one locus doesn't change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the [[Bayes' theorem#Bayes' theorem derived via conditional probabilities|product rule for probabilities]] can be applied. This means that if someone has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, we can say that the probability of having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1x10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Felch|first = Jason|coauthors = et al|title = FBI resists scrutiny of 'matches'|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|pages = P8|date = July 20, 2008|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/20/local/me-dna20|accessdate =&lt;!--March 18,2010--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, since there are about 12 million [[monozygotic twins]] on Earth, the theoretical probability is not accurate.

In practice, the risk of contaminated-matching is much greater than matching a distant relative, such as a sample being contaminated from nearby objects, or from left-over cells transferred from a prior test. Logically, the risk is greater for matching the most common person in the samples: everything collected from, or in contact with, a victim is a major source of contamination for any other samples brought into a lab. For that reason, multiple control-samples are typically tested, to ensure that they stayed clean, when prepared during the same period as the actual test samples. Unexpected matches (or variations) in several control-samples indicates a high probability of contamination for the actual test samples. In a relationship test, the full DNA profiles should differ (except for twins), to prove that a person wasn't actually matched as being related to their own DNA in another sample.

===AmpFLP===
{{Main|Amplified fragment length polymorphism}}

Another technique, AmpFLP, or amplified fragment length polymorphism was also put into practice during the early 1990s. This technique was also faster than RFLP analysis and used [[PCR]] to amplify DNA samples. It relied on [[variable number tandem repeat]] (VNTR) polymorphisms to distinguish various alleles, which were separated on a [[polyacrylamide gel]] using an allelic ladder (as opposed to a molecular weight ladder). Bands could be visualized by [[silver staining]] the gel. One popular locus for fingerprinting was the D1S80 locus. As with all PCR based methods, highly degraded DNA or very small amounts of DNA may cause allelic dropout (causing a mistake in thinking a heterozygote is a homozygote) or other stochastic effects. In addition, because the analysis is done on a gel, very high number repeats may bunch together at the top of the gel, making it difficult to resolve. AmpFLP analysis can be highly automated, and allows for easy creation of [[phylogenetic]] trees based on comparing individual samples of DNA. Due to its relatively low cost and ease of set-up and operation, AmpFLP remains popular in lower income countries.

===DNA family relationship analysis===

Using [[PCR]] technology, DNA analysis is widely applied to determine genetic family relationships such as paternity, maternity, siblingship and other kinships.

During conception, the father’s sperm cell and the mother’s egg cell, each containing half the amount of DNA found in other body cells, meet and fuse to form a fertilized egg, called a zygote. The zygote contains a complete set of DNA molecules, a unique combination of DNA from both parents. This zygote divides and multiplies into an embryo and later, a full human being.

At each stage of development, all the cells forming the body contain the same DNA—half from the father and half from the mother. This fact allows the relationship testing to use all types of all samples including loose cells from the cheeks collected using buccal swabs, blood or other types of samples.

While a lot of DNA contains information for a certain function, there is some called junk DNA, which is currently used for human identification. At some special locations (called loci) in the junk DNA, predictable inheritance patterns were found to be useful in determining biological relationships. These locations contain specific DNA markers that DNA scientists use to identify individuals. In a routine DNA paternity test, the markers used are [[Short Tandem Repeats]] (STRs), short pieces of DNA that occur in highly differential repeat patterns among individuals.

Each person’s DNA contains two copies of these markers—one copy inherited from the father and one from the mother. Within a population, the markers at each person’s DNA location could differ in length and sometimes sequence, depending on the markers inherited from the parents.

The combination of marker sizes found in each person makes up his/her unique genetic profile. When determining the relationship between two individuals, their genetic profiles are compared to see if they share the same inheritance patterns at a statistically conclusive rate.

For example, the following sample report from this commercial DNA paternity testing laboratory Universal Genetics signifies how relatedness between parents and child is identified on those special markers:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! DNA Marker
! Mother
! Child
! Alleged father
|-
| D21S11
| 28, 30
| 28, 31
| 29, 31
|-
| D7S820
| 9, 10
| 10, 11
| 11, 12
|-
| TH01
| 14, 15
| 14, 16
| 15, 16
|-
| D13S317
| 7, 8
| 7, 9
| 8, 9
|-
| D19S433
| 14, 16.2
| 14, 15
| 15, 17
|}

The partial results indicate that the child and the alleged father’s DNA match among these five markers. The complete test results show this correlation on 16 markers between the child and the tested man to draw a conclusion of whether or not the man is the biological father.

Scientifically, each marker is assigned with a Paternity Index (PI), which is a statistical measure of how powerfully a match at a particular marker indicates paternity. The PI of each marker is multiplied with each other to generate the Combined Paternity Index (CPI), which indicates the overall probability of an individual being the biological father of the tested child relative to any random man from the entire population of the same race. The CPI is then converted into a Probability of Paternity showing the degree of relatedness between the alleged father and child.

The DNA test report in other family relationship tests, such as grandparentage and siblingship tests, is similar to a paternity test report. Instead of the Combined Paternity Index, a different value, such as a Siblingship Index, is reported.

The report shows the genetic profiles of each tested person. If there are markers shared among the tested individuals, the probability of biological relationship is calculated to determine how likely the tested individuals share the same markers due to a blood relationship.

===Y-chromosome analysis===
Recent innovations have included the creation of primers targeting polymorphic regions on the Y-chromosome ([[Y-STR]]), which allows resolution of a mixed DNA sample from a male and female and/or cases in which a [[differential extraction]] is not possible. Y-chromosomes are paternally inherited, so Y-STR analysis can help in the identification of paternally related males. Y-STR analysis was performed in the [[Sally Hemings]] controversy to determine if [[Thomas Jefferson]] had sired a son with one of his slaves.

===Mitochondrial analysis===
{{Main|Mitochondrial DNA}}

For highly degraded samples, it is sometimes impossible to get a complete profile of the 13 CODIS STRs. In these situations, [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) is sometimes typed due to there being many copies of mtDNA in a cell, while there may only be 1-2 copies of the nuclear DNA. Forensic scientists amplify the HV1 and HV2 regions of the mtDNA, then sequence each region and compare single-nucleotide differences to a reference. Because mtDNA is maternally inherited, directly linked maternal relatives can be used as match references, such as one's maternal grandmother's daughter's son. A difference of two or more nucleotides is generally considered to be an exclusion. [[Heteroplasmy]] and poly-C differences may throw off straight sequence comparisons, so some expertise on the part of the analyst is required. mtDNA is useful in determining clear identities, such as those of missing people when a maternally linked relative can be found. mtDNA testing was used in determining that [[Anna Anderson]] was not the Russian princess she had claimed to be, [[Anastasia Romanov]].

mtDNA can be obtained from such material as hair shafts and old bones/teeth.

==DNA databases==
{{Main|National DNA database}}
There are now several [[DNA database]]s in existence around the world. Some are private, but most of the largest databases are government controlled. The [[United States]] maintains the largest [[DNA database]], with the [[Combined DNA Index System]], holding over 5 million records as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/codis/national.htm |title=CODIS&amp;nbsp;— National DNA Index System |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] maintains the [[United Kingdom National DNA Database|National DNA Database]] (NDNAD), which is of similar size, despite the UK's smaller population. The size of this database, and its rate of growth, is giving concern to [[civil liberties]] groups in the UK, where police have wide-ranging powers to take samples and retain them even in the event of acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Identification_by_body_samples_and_impressions#Section_82:_Restrictions_on_use_and_destruction_of_fingerprints_and_samples |title=Restrictions on use and destruction of fingerprints and samples |publisher=Wikicrimeline.co.uk |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[USA PATRIOT Act|U.S. Patriot Act]] of the United States provides a means for the U.S. government to get DNA samples from other countries if they{{Clarify|date=April 2008}} &lt;!--who? employees? you can't get a DNA sample for a division or a head office--&gt;are either a division of, or head office of, a company operating in the U.S. Under the act, the American offices of the company can't divulge to their subsidiaries/offices in other countries the reasons that these DNA samples are sought or by whom.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

When a match is made from a National DNA Databank to link a crime scene to an offender who has provided a DNA Sample to a databank that link is often referred to as a ''cold hit''. A cold hit is of value in referring the police agency to a specific suspect but is of less evidential value than a DNA match made from outside the DNA Databank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=DNA&amp;nbsp;— A Practical Guide|authors=Rose &amp; Goos|publisher=Carswell Publications|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations when evaluating DNA evidence==
In the early days of the use of genetic fingerprinting as criminal evidence, juries were often swayed by spurious statistical arguments by defense lawyers along these lines: given a match that had a 1 in 5 million probability of occurring by chance, the lawyer would argue that this meant that in a country of say 60 million people there were 12 people who would also match the profile. This was then translated to a 1 in 12 chance of the suspect being the guilty one. This argument is not sound unless the suspect was drawn at random from the population of the country. In fact, a jury should consider how likely it is that an individual matching the genetic profile would also have been a suspect in the case for other reasons. Another spurious statistical argument is based on the false assumption that a 1 in 5 million probability of a match automatically translates into a 1 in 5 million probability of innocence and is known as the [[prosecutor's fallacy]].

When using [[RFLP]], the theoretical risk of a coincidental match is 1 in 100 billion (100,000,000,000), although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1000 because [[monozygotic twins]] are 0.2% of the human population.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Moreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than this, and often actual laboratory procedures do not reflect the theory under which the coincidence probabilities were computed. For example, the coincidence probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in two samples have bands in ''precisely'' the same location, but a laboratory worker may conclude that similar—but not precisely identical—band patterns result from identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the agarose gel. However, in this case, the laboratory worker increases the coincidence risk by expanding the criteria for declaring a match. Recent studies have quoted relatively high error rates which may be cause for concern.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Paton Walsh [http://www.guardian.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,640157,00.html False result fear over DNA tests] [[The Observer]], Sunday 27 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of genetic fingerprinting, the necessary population data to accurately compute a match probability was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary low ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis rather than the higher theoretically computed ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook/0309053951/html/35.html The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence] 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, RFLP has become widely disused due to the advent of more discriminating, sensitive and easier technologies.

Since 1998 the DNA profiling system supported by The National DNA Database in the UK is the [[SGM+]] DNA profiling system which includes 10 STR regions and a sex indicating test. [[Short tandem repeat|STRs]] do not suffer from such subjectivity and provide similar power of discrimination (1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; for unrelated individuals if using a full [[SGM+]] profile). It should be noted that figures of this magnitude are not considered to be statistically supportable by scientists in the UK, for unrelated individuals with full matching DNA profiles a match probability of 1 in a billion is considered statistically supportable. However, with any DNA technique, the cautious juror should not convict on genetic fingerprint evidence alone if other factors raise doubt. Contamination with other evidence (secondary transfer) is a key source of incorrect DNA profiles and raising doubts as to whether a sample has been adulterated is a favorite defense technique. More rarely, [[chimerism]] is one such instance where the lack of a genetic match may unfairly exclude a suspect.

===Evidence of genetic relationship===
It's also possible to use DNA profiling as evidence of genetic relationship, but testing that shows no relationship is absolutely certain. While almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, rare individuals, known as &quot;[[chimera (genetics)|chimeras]]&quot;, have at least two different sets of genes. There have been several cases of DNA profiling that falsely suggested that a mother was unrelated to her children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2315693 |title=Two Women Don't Match Their Kids' DNA |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-08-15 |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake DNA evidence==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The value of DNA evidence has to be seen in light of recent cases where criminals planted fake DNA samples at crime scenes. In one case, a criminal even planted fake DNA evidence in his own body: Dr. [[John Schneeberger]] raped one of his sedated patients in 1992 and left semen on her underwear. Police drew what they believed to be Schneeberger's blood and compared its DNA against the crime scene semen DNA on three occasions, never showing a match. It turned out that he had surgically inserted a [[Penrose drain]] into his arm and filled it with foreign blood and [[anticoagulant]]s.

The functional analysis of genes and their coding sequences (open reading frames [ORFs]) typically requires that each ORF be expressed, the encoded protein purified, antibodies produced, phenotypes examined, intracellular localization determined, and interactions with other proteins sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=James L. Hartley, Gary F. Temple, and Michael A. Brasch|title=DNA Cloning Using In Vitro Site-Specific Recombination|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study  conducted by the life science company Nucleix and published in the journal Forensic Science International, scientists found that an [[In vitro]] synthesized sample of DNA matching any desired genetic profile can be constructed using standard [[molecular biology]] techniques without obtaining any actual tissue from that person.

In the case of the [[Phantom of Heilbronn]], police detectives found DNA traces from the same woman on various crime scenes in Austria, Germany and France&amp;nbsp;— among them murders, burglaries and robberies. Only after the DNA of the &quot;woman&quot; matched the DNA sampled from the burned body of a ''male'' asylum seeker in France, detectives began to have serious doubts about the DNA evidence. In that case, DNA traces were already present on the cotton swabs used to collect the samples at the crime scene, and the swabs had all been produced at the same factory in Austria. The company's product specification said that the swabs were guaranteed to be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]], but not DNA-free.

===Familial DNA searching===
Familial DNA searching (sometimes referred to as “Familial DNA” or “Familial DNA Database Searching”) is the practice of creating new investigative leads in cases where DNA evidence found at the scene of a crime (forensic profile) strongly resembles that of an existing DNA profile (offender profile) in a state DNA database but there is not an exact match.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Diane. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/diane-dimond/searching-the-family-dna-_b_845340.html &quot;Searching the Family DNA Tree to Solve Crime.&quot;] The Huffington Post accessed April 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bieber, Frederick et al.,(2006)[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/312/5778/1315.short “Finding Criminals Through DNA of Their Relatives”] Science. 312 Sci. 1315, 1315–16.&lt;/ref&gt; After all other leads have been exhausted, investigators may use specially developed software to compare the forensic profile to all profiles taken from a state’s DNA database in order to generate a list of those offenders most likely to be a close relative of the forensic profile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaforensics.com/FamilialSearches.aspx#uk “Science of the Future: Identifying Criminals Through Their Family Members”].&lt;/ref&gt; To eliminate the majority of this list, crime lab technicians conduct [[Y-STR]] analysis that confirms the familial relationships suggested by the first list. Using standard investigative techniques, authorities are then able to build a family tree. The family tree is populated from information gathered from [[public records]] and criminal justice records. Investigators rule out family members’ involvement in the crime by finding excluding factors such as sex, living out of state or being incarcerated when the crime was committed. They may also use other leads from the case, such as [[witness]] or victim statements, to identify a suspect. Once a suspect has been identified, investigators seek to legally obtain a DNA sample from the suspect. This suspect DNA profile is then compared to the sample found at the crime scene, in accordance with well established and constitutionally accepted practices, to definitively identify the suspect as the source of the crime scene DNA.

Familial DNA database searching was first used to convict Craig Harman of manslaughter in the United Kingdom on April 19, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, Shaoni [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4908-killer-convicted-thanks-to-relatives-dna.html “Killer Convicted Thanks to Relative's DNA.”] New Scientist accessed April 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, familial DNA database searching is not conducted on a national level in the United States. States determine their own policies and decision making processes for how and when to conduct familial searches. The first familial DNA search and subsequent conviction in the United States was conducted in [[Denver, Colorado]] in 2008 using software developed under the leadership of [[Denver District Attorney]] [[Mitch Morrissey]] and Denver Police Department Crime Lab Director Gregg LaBerge.&lt;ref&gt;Pankratz, Howard.

At a press conference in Virginia on March 7, 2011 regarding the East Coast Rapist, Prince William County prosecutor Paul Ebert and Fairfax County Police Detective John Kelly said the case would have been solved years ago if Virginia had used familial DNA searching. Aaron Thomas, the suspected East Coast Rapist, was arrested in connection with the rape of 17 women from Virginia to Rhode Island, but familial DNA was not used in the case.&lt;ref&gt;Christoffersen, John and Barakat, Matthew. [http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/mar/08/other-victims-of-east-coast-rapist-suspect-sought/ &quot;Other victims of East Coast Rapist suspect sought.&quot;] Associated Press. Accessed May 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of familial DNA database searches argue that the technique may be an invasion of an individual’s [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Erin Elizabeth, (2009). [http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/109/3/murphy.pdf “Relative Doubt: Familial Searches of DNA Databases”] Michigan Law Review, Vol. 109, 291-348, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have pointed out that the privacy concerns surrounding familial searching are no more threatening than other police search techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Suter, Sonia. [http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v23.2/23HarvJLTech309.pdf “ All in The Family: Privacy and DNA Familial Searching”] (2010). Harvard Journal of Law and Technology, Vol. 23,328, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in United States v. Pool ruled that this practice is somewhat analogous to a witness looking at a photograph of one person and stating that it looked like the perpetrator, which leads law enforcement to show the witness photos of similar looking individuals, one of whom is identified as the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/14/09-10303.pdf “US v. Pool”] Pool 621F .3d 1213.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether familial DNA searching was the method used to identify the suspect, authorities always conduct a normal DNA test to match the suspect’s DNA with that of the DNA left at the crime scene.

For instance, investigators with Denver District Attorney’s Office successfully identified a suspect in a property theft case using a familial DNA search. In this example, the suspect’s blood left at the scene of the crime strongly resembled that of a current [[Colorado Department of Corrections]] prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Pankratz, Howard.[http://www.denverpost.com/denver/ci_13801125 &quot;Denver Uses ‘Familial DNA Evidence’ to Solve Car Break-Ins.&quot;] The Denver Post accessed April 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Using publicly available records, the investigators created a family tree. They then eliminated all the family members who were incarcerated at the time of the offense, as well as all of the females (the crime scene DNA profile was that of a male). Investigators obtained a court order to collect the suspect’s DNA, but the suspect actually volunteered to come to a police station and give a DNA sample. After providing the sample, the suspect walked free without further interrogation or detainment. Later confronted with an exact match to the forensic profile, the suspect pled guilty to criminal trespass at the first court date and was sentenced to two years probation.

===Partial DNA Matches===
Partial DNA matches are not searches themselves, but are the result of moderate stringency CODIS searches that produce a potential match that shares at least one [[allele]] at every [[locus (genetics)|locus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chromosomal-labs.com/files/FindingCriminals.pdf &quot;Finding Criminals Through DNA Testing of Their Relatives&quot;] Technical Bulletin, Chromosomal Laboratories, Inc. accessed April 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Partial matching does not involve the use of a familial search software, such as those used in the UK and Denver, or additional [[Y-STR]] analysis, and therefore often misses sibling relationships. Partial matching has been used to identify suspects in several cases in the UK and US&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverda.org/DNA/Familial_DNA_Database_Searches.htm “Denver District Attorney DNA Resources”] accessed April 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been used as a tool to exonerate the falsely accused. [[Darryl Hunt]] was wrongly convicted in connection with the rape and murder of a young woman in 1984 in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innocenceproject.org/news/Blog-Search.php?check=true&amp;tag=134 “Darryl Hunt, The Innocence Project”].&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt was exonerated in 2004 when a DNA database search produced a remarkably close match between a convicted felon and the forensic profile from the case. The partial match led investigators to the felon’s brother, Willard E. Brown, who confessed to the crime when confronted by police. A judge then signed an order to dismiss the case with prejudice against Hunt, ending the long ordeal for this innocent man.

===Surreptitious DNA collecting===
Police forces may collect DNA samples without the suspects' knowledge, and use it as evidence. Legality of this mode of proceeding has been questioned in [[Australia]].

In the United States, it has been accepted, courts often claiming that there was no [[expectation of privacy]], citing [[California v. Greenwood]] (1985), during which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] does not prohibit the [[Search warrant|warrantless]] search and seizure of [[Waste|garbage]] left for collection outside the [[curtilage]] of a [[home]]. Critics of this practice underline the fact that this analogy ignores that &quot;most people have no idea that they risk surrendering their genetic identity to the police by, for instance, failing to destroy a used coffee cup. Moreover, even if they do realize it, there is no way to avoid abandoning one’s DNA in public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Amy Harmon]], [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/science/03dna.html Lawyers Fight DNA Samples Gained on Sly], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[UK]], the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]] prohibited private individuals from covertly collecting biological samples (hair, fingernails, etc.) for DNA analysis, but excluded medical and criminal investigations from the offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Scientificdevelopmentgeneticsandbioethics/Tissue/TissueGeneralInformation/DH_4102169 Human Tissue Act 2004], UK, available in pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Members of the Jury, if you accept the scientific evidence called by the Crown, this indicates that there are probably only four or five white males in the United Kingdom from whom that semen stain could have come. The Defendant is one of them. If that is the position, the decision you have to reach, on all the evidence, is whether you are sure that it was the Defendant who left that stain or whether it is possible that it was one of that other small group of men who share the same DNA characteristics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Juries should weigh up conflicting and corroborative evidence, using their own common sense and not by using mathematical formulae, such as [[Bayes' theorem]], so as to avoid &quot;confusion, misunderstanding and misjudgment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII

:“We can see no reason why partial profile DNA evidence should not be admissible provided that the jury are made aware of its inherent limitations and are given a sufficient explanation to enable them to evaluate it. There may be cases where the match probability in relation to all the samples tested is so great that the judge would consider its probative value to be minimal and decide to exclude the evidence in the exercise of his discretion, but this gives rise to no new question of principle and can be left for decision on a case by case basis. However, the fact that there exists in the case of all partial profile evidence the possibility that a &quot;missing&quot; allele might exculpate the accused altogether does not provide sufficient grounds for rejecting such evidence. In many there is a possibility (at least in theory) that evidence exists which would assist the accused and perhaps even exculpate him altogether, but that does not provide grounds for excluding relevant evidence that is available and otherwise admissible, though it does make it important to ensure that the jury are given sufficient information to enable them to evaluate that evidence properly”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=DNA_profiling#Presentation_and_evaluation_of_evidence_of_partial_or_incomplete_DNA_profiles |title=WikiCrimeLine DNA profiling |publisher=Wikicrimeline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of artificial DNA===
{{Essay-like|section|date=April 2010}}
In August 2009, scientists in Israel raised serious doubts concerning the use of DNA by law enforcement as the ultimate method of identification. In a paper published in the journal ''Forensic Science International: Genetics'', the Israeli researchers demonstrated that it is possible to manufacture DNA in a laboratory, thus falsifying DNA evidence. The scientists fabricated saliva and blood samples, which originally contained DNA from a person other than the supposed donor of the blood and saliva.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/science/18dna.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=DNA Evidence Can Be Fabricated, Scientists Show|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|date=August 18, 2009|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also showed that, using a DNA database, it is possible to take information from a profile and manufacture DNA to match it, and that this can be done without access to any actual DNA from the person whose DNA they are duplicating. The synthetic DNA oligos required for the procedure are common in molecular laboratories.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack&quot;/&gt;

''The New York Times'' quoted the lead author on the paper, Dr. Daniel Frumkin, saying, &quot;You can just engineer a crime scene... any biology undergraduate could perform this.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack&quot;/&gt;

Dr. Frumkin perfected a test that can differentiate real DNA samples from fake ones. His test detects [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] modifications, in particular, [[DNA methylation]]. Seventy percent of the DNA in any human genome is methylated, meaning it contains methyl group modifications within a CpG dinucleotide context. Methylation at the promoter region is associated with gene silencing. The synthetic DNA lacks this epigenetic modification, which allows the test to distinguish manufactured DNA from original, genuine, DNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollack&quot;/&gt;

It is unknown how many police departments, if any, currently use the test. No police lab has publicly announced that it is using the new test to verify DNA results.&lt;ref name=&quot;frumkin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsigenetics.com/article/S1872-4973(09)00099-4/abstract |title=Elsevier |publisher=Fsigenetics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1986, Richard Buckland was exonerated, despite having admitted to the rape and murder of a teenager near [[Leicester]], the city where DNA profiling was first discovered. This was the first use of DNA finger printing in a criminal investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8245312.stm|work=BBC News|title=DNA pioneer's 'eureka' moment|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1987, [[Florida]] rapist Tommy Lee Andrews was the first person in the United States to be convicted as a result of DNA evidence, for raping a woman during a burglary; he was convicted on November 6, 1987, and sentenced to 22 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.txtwriter.com/Backgrounders/Genetech/GEpage14.html |title=Gene Technology&amp;nbsp;— Page 14 |publisher=Txtwriter.com |date=1987-11-06 |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/case/revolution/databases.html |title=frontline: the case for innocence: the dna revolution: state and federal dna database laws examined |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1988, [[Timothy Wilson Spencer]] was the first man in [[Virginia]] to be sentenced to death through DNA testing, for several rape and murder charges. He was dubbed &quot;The South Side Strangler&quot; because he killed victims on the south side of Richmond, Virginia. He was later charged with rape and first-degree murder and was sentenced to death. He was executed on April 27, 1994. David Vasquez, initially convicted of one of Spencer's crimes, became the first man in [[United States|America]] exonerated based on DNA evidence.
*In 1989, [[Chicago]] man [[Gary Dotson]] was the first person whose conviction was overturned using DNA evidence.
*In 1991, [[Allan Legere]] was the first [[Canada|Canadian]] to be convicted as a result of DNA evidence, for four murders he had committed while an escaped prisoner in 1989. During his trial, his defense argued that the relatively shallow gene pool of the region could lead to false positives.
*In 1992, DNA evidence was used to prove that [[Nazism|Nazi]] doctor [[Josef Mengele]] was buried in [[Brazil]] under the name Wolfgang Gerhard.
*In 1992, DNA from a palo verde tree was used to convict Mark Alan Bogan of murder. DNA from seed pods of a tree at the crime scene was found to match that of seed pods found in Bogan's truck.

*In 1993, [[Kirk Bloodsworth]] was the first person to have been convicted of [[murder]] and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], whose conviction was overturned using DNA evidence.
*The 1993 rape and murder of [[Mia Zapata]], lead singer for the Seattle punk band [[The Gits]] was unsolved nine years after the murder. A database search in 2001 failed, but the killer's DNA was collected when he was arrested in Florida for burglary and domestic abuse in 2002.
*The science was made famous in the [[United States]] in 1994 when prosecutors heavily relied on DNA evidence allegedly linking [[O. J. Simpson]] to a [[O. J. Simpson murder case|double murder]]. The case also brought to light the laboratory difficulties and handling procedure mishaps which can cause such evidence to be significantly doubted.
*In 1994, [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) detectives successfully tested hairs from a cat known as [[Snowball the Cat|Snowball]], and used the test to link a man to the murder of his wife, thus marking for the first time in forensic history the use of non-human DNA to identify a criminal.
*In 1998, Dr. [[Richard J. Schmidt]] was convicted of attempted second-degree murder when it was shown that there was a link between the [[viral DNA]] of the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) he had been accused of injecting in his girlfriend and viral DNA from one of his patients with AIDS. This was the first time viral DNA fingerprinting had been used as evidence in a criminal trial.
*In 1999, Raymond Easton, a disabled man from [[Swindon]], England, was arrested and detained for seven hours in connection with a burglary. He was released due to an inaccurate DNA match. His DNA had been retained on file after an unrelated domestic incident some time previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1933724,00.html |title = Suspect Nation |publisher = The Guardian |date = 2006-10-08|location=London|first=Stuart|last=Jeffries|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In May 2000 Gordon Graham murdered Paul Gault at his home in Lisburn, Northern Ireland. Graham was convicted of the murder when his DNA was found on a sports bag left in the house as part of an elaborate ploy to suggest the murder occurred after a burglary had gone wrong.

*In 2002, the body of [[James Hanratty]], hanged in 1962 for the &quot;A6 murder&quot;, was exhumed and DNA samples from the body and members of his family were analysed.

*In 2002, DNA testing was used to exonerate [[Douglas Echols]], a man who was wrongfully convicted in a 1986 rape case. Echols was the 114th person to be exonerated through post-conviction DNA testing.
*In August 2002, Annalisa Vincenzi was shot dead in [[Tuscany]]. Bartender Peter Hamkin, 23, was arrested, in [[Merseyside]], in March 2003 on an extradition warrant heard at [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court]] in [[London]] to establish whether he should be taken to [[Italy]] to face a murder charge.

*In 2003, Welshman Jeffrey Gafoor was convicted of the 1988 murder of Lynette White, when crime scene evidence collected 12 years earlier was re-examined using [[Short tandem repeat|STR]] techniques, resulting in a match with his nephew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Satish Sekar |url=http://lifeloom.com/I2Sekar.htm |title=Lynette White Case: How Forensics Caught the Cellophane Man |publisher=Lifeloom.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be the first known example of the DNA of an innocent yet related individual being used to identify the actual criminal, via &quot;familial searching&quot;.
*In March 2003, Josiah Sutton was released from prison after serving four years of a twelve-year sentence for a sexual assault charge. Questionable DNA samples taken from Sutton were retested in the wake of the Houston Police Department's crime lab scandal of mishandling DNA evidence.
*In June 2003, because of new DNA evidence, Dennis Halstead, John Kogut and John Restivo won a re-trial on their murder conviction. The three men had already served eighteen years of their thirty-plus-year sentences.
*The trial of [[Robert Pickton]] (convicted in December 2003) is notable in that DNA evidence is being used primarily to identify the ''victims'', and in many cases to prove their existence.
*In 2004, DNA testing shed new light into the mysterious 1912 disappearance of [[Bobby Dunbar]], a four-year-old boy who vanished during a fishing trip. He was allegedly found alive eight months later in the custody of William Cantwell Walters, but another woman claimed that the boy was her son, Bruce Anderson, whom she had entrusted in Walters' custody. The courts disbelieved her claim and convicted Walters for the kidnapping. The boy was raised and known as Bobby Dunbar throughout the rest of his life. However, DNA tests on Dunbar's son and nephew revealed the two were not related, thus establishing that the boy found in 1912 was not Bobby Dunbar, whose real fate remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-05-05-1914-dna_x.htm DNA clears man of 1914 kidnapping conviction]&quot;, ''[[USA Today]]'', (May 5, 2004), by Allen G. Breed, [[Associated Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2005, Gary Leiterman was convicted of the 1969 murder of Jane Mixer, a law student at the [[University of Michigan]], after DNA found on Mixer's [[pantyhose]] was matched to Leiterman. DNA in a drop of blood on Mixer's hand was matched to John Ruelas, who was only four years old in 1969 and was never successfully connected to the case in any other way. Leiterman's defense unsuccessfully argued that the unexplained match of the blood spot to Ruelas pointed to cross-contamination and raised doubts about the reliability of the lab's identification of Leiterman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/22/48hours/main1066064.shtml CBS News] story on the Jane Mixer murder case; March 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/17/earlyshow/main3065082.shtml CBS News] story on the Mixer case; July 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garyisinnocent.org An advocacy site] challenging Leiterman's conviction in the Mixer murder.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In December 2005, Evan Simmons was proven innocent of a 1981 attack on an Atlanta woman after serving twenty-four years in prison. Mr. Clark is the 164th person in the United States and the fifth in Georgia to be freed using post-conviction DNA testing.
*In March 2009, [[Sean Hodgson]] who spent 27 years in jail, convicted of killing Teresa De Simone, 22, in her car in [[Southampton]] 30 years ago was released by senior judges. Tests prove DNA from the scene was not his. British police have now reopened the case.

Most other DNA present in eukaryotic organisms is found in the [[cell nucleus]].

Mitochondrial DNA can be regarded as the smallest [[chromosome]], and was the first significant part of the [[human genome]] to be sequenced. In most species, including humans, mtDNA is inherited solely from the mother.

The DNA sequence of mtDNA has been determined from a large number of organisms and individuals (including some organisms that are extinct), and the comparison of those DNA sequences represents a mainstay of [[phylogenetics]], in that it allows biologists to elucidate the [[evolutionary]] relationships among species. It also permits an examination of the relatedness of populations, and so has become important in [[anthropology]] and field biology.

==Replication==
mtDNA is replicated by the [[DNA polymerase]] gamma complex which is composed of a 140 kDa catalytic DNA polymerase encoded by the ''[[POLG]]'' gene and a 55 kDa accessory subunit encoded by the ''[[POLG2]]'' gene. During [[embryogenesis]], replication of mtDNA is strictly down-regulated from the fertilized oocyte through the preimplantation embryo.&lt;ref name=John2010/&gt; At the [[blastocyst]] stage, the onset of mtDNA replication is specific to the cells of the [[trophectoderm]].&lt;ref name=John2010/&gt; In contrast, the cells of the [[inner cell mass]] restrict mtDNA replication until they receive the [[Cell signaling|signals]] to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to specific cell types.&lt;ref name=John2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=John JC, Facucho-Oliveira J, Jiang Y, Kelly R, Salah R |title=Mitochondrial DNA transmission, replication and inheritance: a journey from the gamete through the embryo and into offspring and embryonic stem cells |journal=Hum Reprod Update |volume= 16|issue= 5|pages= 488–509|year=2010 |month=March |pmid=20231166 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmq002 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are thought to be of separate [[evolution]]ary origin, with the mtDNA being derived from the [[circular DNA|circular genomes]] of the [[bacteria]] that were engulfed by the early ancestors of today's eukaryotic cells. This theory is called the [[endosymbiotic theory]]. Each mitochondrion is estimated to contain 2-10 mtDNA copies.&lt;ref name=Wiesner&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wiesner RJ, Ruegg JC, Morano I |year=1992 |title=Counting target molecules by exponential polymerase chain reaction, copy number of mitochondrial DNA in rat tissues | journal=Biochim Biophys Acta. | volume=183 |pages=553–559 |pmid=1550563 | issue=2 | doi=10.1016/0006-291X(92)90517-O}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cells of extant organisms, the vast majority of the proteins present in the mitochondria (numbering approximately 1500 different types in [[mammal]]s) are coded for by [[nuclear DNA]], but the genes for some of them, if not most, are thought to have originally been of bacterial origin, having since been transferred to the eukaryotic nucleus during [[evolution]].

== Mitochondrial inheritance ==
In most [[metazoans|multicellular organisms]], mtDNA is inherited from the mother (maternally inherited). Mechanisms for this include simple dilution (an egg contains 100,000 to 1,000,000 mtDNA molecules, whereas a [[sperm]] contains only 100 to 1000), degradation of sperm mtDNA in the fertilized egg, and, at least in a few organisms, failure of sperm mtDNA to enter the egg. Whatever the mechanism, this single parent (uniparental) pattern of mtDNA inheritance is found in most animals, most plants and in fungi as well.

=== Female inheritance ===

In [[sexual reproduction]], mitochondria are normally inherited exclusively from the mother. The mitochondria in mammalian sperm are usually destroyed by the egg cell after fertilization. Also, most mitochondria are present at the base of the sperm's tail, which is used for propelling the sperm cells. Sometimes the tail is lost during fertilization. In 1999 it was reported that paternal sperm mitochondria (containing mtDNA) are marked with [[ubiquitin]] to select them for later destruction inside the [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sutovsky, P., et al.|year=Nov. 25, 1999|title=Ubiquitin tag for sperm mitochondria|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=402|pages=371–372|pmid=10586873|doi=10.1038/46466 | issue=6760}} Discussed in [http://web.archive.org/web/20071219174548/http://www.sciencenews.org/20000101/fob3.asp].&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''[[in vitro]]'' fertilization techniques, particularly injecting a sperm into an [[oocyte]], may interfere with this.

The fact that mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited enables researchers to trace [[Matrilineality|maternal lineage]] far back in time. ([[Y chromosome | Y-chromosomal DNA]], paternally inherited, is used in an analogous way to trace the [[agnate]] lineage.) This is accomplished in humans by sequencing one or more of the [[hypervariable control region]]s (HVR1 or HVR2) of the mitochondrial DNA, as with a [[genealogical DNA test]]. HVR1 consists of about 440 base pairs. These 440 base pairs are then compared to the control regions of other individuals (either specific people or subjects in a database) to determine maternal lineage. Most often, the comparison is made to the revised [[Cambridge Reference Sequence]]. Vilà ''et al.'' have published studies tracing the matrilineal descent of domestic dogs to wolves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vila&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of the [[Mitochondrial Eve]] is based on the same type of analysis, attempting to discover the origin of [[human]]ity by tracking the lineage back in time.

Because mtDNA is not highly conserved and has a rapid mutation rate, it is useful for studying the evolutionary relationships - [[phylogeny]] - of organisms. Biologists can determine and then compare mtDNA sequences among different species and use the comparisons to build an [[evolutionary tree]] for the species examined.

Because mtDNA is transmitted from mother to child (both male and female), it can be a useful tool in [[Genetic genealogy|genealogical]] research into a person's maternal line.

While many of these cases involve cloned embryos or subsequent rejection of the paternal mitochondria, others document ''[[in vivo]]'' inheritance and persistence under lab conditions.

==Structure==
In humans (and probably in [[metazoans]] in general), 100-10,000 separate copies of mtDNA are usually present per cell (egg and [[Spermatozoon|sperm cells]] are exceptions). In mammals, each double-stranded circular mtDNA [[molecule]] consists of [http://www.ramsdale.org/genetic.htm 15,000-17,000] [[base pair]]s. The two strands of mtDNA are differentiated by their nucleotide content with the guanine rich strand referred to as the heavy strand, and the cytosine rich strand referred to as the light strand. The heavy strand encodes 28 genes, and the light strand encodes 9 genes for a total of 37 genes. Of the 37 genes, 13 are for proteins (polypeptides), 22 are for [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) and two are for the small and large subunits of [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA). This pattern is also seen among most metazoans, although in some cases one or more of the 37 genes is absent and the mtDNA size range is greater. Even greater variation in mtDNA gene content and size exists among fungi and plants, although there appears to be a core subset of genes that are present in all eukaryotes (except for the few that have no mitochondria at all). Some plant species have enormous mtDNAs (as many as 2,500,000 base pairs per mtDNA molecule) but, surprisingly, even those huge mtDNAs contain the same number and kinds of genes as related plants with much smaller mtDNAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ward BL, Anderson RS, Bendich AJ |title=The mitochondrial genome is large and variable in a family of plants (cucurbitaceae) |journal=Cell |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=793–803 |year=1981 |month=September |pmid=6269758 |doi= 10.1016/0092-8674(81)90187-2|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0092-8674(81)90187-2 |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mutations ==

[[File:Mitochondrial DNA and diseases.svg|thumb|The involvement of mitochondrial DNA in several human diseases.]]

===Susceptibility===
mtDNA is particularly susceptible to [[reactive oxygen species]] generated by the [[respiratory chain]] due to its proximity.  Though mtDNA is packaged by proteins and harbors significant [[DNA repair]] capacity, these protective functions are less robust than those operating on nuclear DNA and therefore thought to contribute to enhanced susceptibility of mtDNA to oxidative damage. The outcome of mutation in mtDNA may be alteration in the coding instructions for some proteins,&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Mutation?topic=49496 ''Mutation''. ed. E.Monosson and C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt; which may have an effect on organism metabolism and/or fitness.

=== Genetic illness ===
{{See|Mitochondrial disease}}
Mutations of mitochondrial DNA can lead to a number of illnesses including [[exercise intolerance]] and [[Kearns-Sayre syndrome]] (KSS), which causes a person to lose full function of heart, eye, and muscle movements. Some evidence suggests that they might be major contributors to the aging process and age-associated pathologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alexeyev| first1 = Mikhail F.| last2 = LeDoux| first2 = Susan P.| last3 = Wilson| first3 = Glenn L.| title = Mitochondrial DNA and aging| journal = Clinical Science| volume = 107| pages = 355–364| date = July 2004| url = http://www.clinsci.org/cs/107/0355/1070355.pdf| doi = 10.1042/CS20040148 | pmid = 15279618 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in Disease Diagnosis===

Recently a mutation in mtDNA has been used to help diagnose prostate cancer in patients with negative [[prostate biopsy]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20944788&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Reguly B, Jakupciak JP, Parr RL.|pmid= 20944788 |year= 2010 |title= 3.4 kb mitochondrial genome deletion serves as a surrogate predictive biomarker for prostate cancer in histopathologically benign biopsy cores |volume= 4 |issue= 5 |pages= E118–22 |pmc= 2950771 |journal= Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20084081&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Robinson K, Creed J, Reguly B, Powell C, Wittock R, Klein D, Maggrah A, Klotz L, Parr RL, Dakubo GD.

== Use in identification ==

In humans, mitochondrial DNA spans 16,569 DNA building blocks (base pairs),&lt;ref&gt;http://chemistry.umeche.maine.edu/CHY431/MitoDNA.html&lt;/ref&gt; representing a fraction of the total DNA in cells. Unlike nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both parents and in which genes are rearranged in the process of [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], there is usually no change in mtDNA from parent to offspring. Although mtDNA also recombines, it does so with copies of itself within the same mitochondrion. Because of this and because the [[mutation rate]] of animal mtDNA is higher than that of nuclear DNA,&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brown WM, George M Jr., Wilson AC |year=1979 | title=Rapid evolution of animal mitochondrial DNA | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume=76 | pages=1967–1971 |pmid=109836 | doi=10.1073/pnas.76.4.1967 | issue=4 | pmc=383514}}&lt;/ref&gt; mtDNA is a powerful tool for tracking ancestry through females ([[matrilineage]]) and has been used in this role to track the ancestry of many species back hundreds of generations.

Human mtDNA can also be used to help identify individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brown WM |year=1980 | title=Polymorphism in mitochondrial DNA of humans as revealed by restriction endonuclease analysis | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=77 | pages=3605–3609 | pmid=6251473 | doi=10.1073/pnas.77.6.3605 | issue=6 | pmc=349666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic laboratories occasionally use mtDNA comparison to identify human remains, and especially to identify older unidentified skeletal remains. Although unlike nuclear DNA, mtDNA is not specific to one individual, it can be used in combination with other evidence (anthropological evidence, [[circumstantial evidence]], and the like) to establish identification. mtDNA is also used to exclude possible matches between [[missing person]]s and unidentified remains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientdna.com/forensic.html Paleo-DNA Laboratory - Forensic Services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers believe that mtDNA is better suited to identification of older skeletal remains than nuclear DNA because the greater number of copies of mtDNA per cell increases the chance of obtaining a useful sample, and because a match with a living relative is possible even if numerous maternal generations separate the two. [[United States|American]] outlaw [[Jesse James]]'s remains were identified using a comparison between mtDNA extracted from his remains and the mtDNA of the son of the female-line great-granddaughter of his sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11210907&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stone AC, Starrs JE, Stoneking M |title=Mitochondrial DNA analysis of the presumptive remains of Jesse James |journal=J. Forensic Sci. |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=173–6 |year=2001 |month=January |pmid=11210907 |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Stone.JFS.2001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the remains of [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)]], last Empress of Russia, and her children were [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)#Identification of remains|identified]] by comparison of their mitochondrial DNA with that of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], whose maternal grandmother was Alexandra’s sister [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine|Victoria of Hesse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8162066&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gill P, Ivanov PL, Kimpton C, ''et al.'' |title=Identification of the remains of the Romanov family by DNA analysis |journal=Nat. Genet. |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=130–5 |year=1994 |month=February |pmid=8162066 |doi=10.1038/ng0294-130 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to identify Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] remains his mitochondrial DNA was compared with that of [[James Carnegie, 3rd Duke of Fife]], whose maternal great-grandmother [[Alexandra of Denmark]] (Queen Alexandra) was sister of Nicholas II mother [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dagmar of Denmark]] (Empress Maria Feodorovna).&lt;ref&gt;The details of the tests were published at Gil et al., 'Identification of the Remains' The Duke of Fife was officially named as the source of the comparison sample of mtDNA in Ivanov, 'Mitochondrial DNA', p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

The low [[effective population size]] and rapid mutation rate (in animals) makes mtDNA useful for assessing genetic relationships of individuals or groups within a species and also for identifying and quantifying the phylogeny (evolutionary relationships; see [[phylogenetics]]) among different species, provided they are not too distantly related. To do this, biologists determine and then compare the mtDNA sequences from different individuals or species. Data from the comparisons is used to construct a network of relationships among the sequences, which provides an estimate of the relationships among the individuals or species from which the mtDNAs were taken.  This approach has limits that are imposed by the rate of mtDNA sequence change. In animals, the high [[mutation rate]] makes mtDNA most useful for comparisons of individuals within species and for comparisons of species that are closely or moderately-closely related, among which the number of sequence differences can be easily counted. As the species become more distantly related, the number of sequence differences becomes very large; changes begin to accumulate on changes until an accurate count becomes impossible.

==History==

Mitochondrial DNA was discovered in the 1960s by Margit M. K. Nass and Sylvan Nass by [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]] as DNase-sensitive thread inside mitochondria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.jcb.org/cgi/reprint/19/3/593.pdf | pmid = 14086138 | volume=19 | title=INTRAMITOCHONDRIAL FIBERS WITH DNA CHARACTERISTICS : I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25391">A '''DNA virus''' is a [[virus]] that has [[DNA]] as its [[genetic material]] and replicates using a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]. The [[nucleic acid]] is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA viruses belong to either ''Group I'' or ''Group II'' of the [[Baltimore classification]] system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although ''Group VII'' viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] contain a DNA genome, they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather [[reverse transcribing viruses]] because they replicate through an RNA intermediate.

==Group I: dsDNA viruses==

[[Genome]] organization within this group varies considerably. Some have circular genomes (''Baculoviridae'', ''Papovaviridae'' and ''Polydnaviridae'') while others have linear genomes (''Adenoviridae'', ''Herpesviridae'' and some phages). Some families have circularly permuted linear genomes ([[phage T4]] and some ''Iridoviridae''). Others have linear genomes with covalently closed ends (''Poxviridae'' and ''Phycodnaviridae'').

A virus infecting archaea was first described in 1974. Several others have been described since: most have head-tail morphologies and linear double-stranded DNA genomes. Other morphologies have also been described: spindle shaped, rod shaped, filamentous, icosahedral and spherical. Additional morphological types may exist. 

[[Order]]s within this group are defined on the basis of morphology rather than DNA sequence similarity. It is thought that morphology is more conserved in this group than sequence similarity or gene order which is extremely variable. Three orders and 33 [[family (biology)|families]] are currently recognised. Four [[genus|genera]] are recognised that have not yet been assigned a family. The [[species]] ''Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus'' is so unlike any previously described virus that it will almost certainly be placed in a new family on the next revision of viral families.

Fifteen families are enveloped. These include all three families in the order ''Herpesvirales'' and the following families: ''Ascoviridae'', ''Ampullaviridae'', ''Asfarviridae'', ''Baculoviridae'', ''Fuselloviridae'', ''Globuloviridae'', ''Guttaviridae'', ''Hytrosaviridae'', ''Iridoviridae'', ''Lipothrixviridae'', ''Nimaviridae'' and ''Poxviridae''.

[[Bacteriophage]]s belonging to the families ''Tectiviridae'' and ''Corticoviridae'' have a lipid bilayer inside the icosahedral [[protein]] capsid and the [[membrane]] surrounds the genome. The crenarchaeal virus ''Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus'' has a similar structure.

The genomes in this group vary considerably from ~20 kilobases to over 1.2 megabases in length.

==Group II: ssDNA viruses==

Although bacteriophages were first described in 1927, it was only in 1959 that Sinshemer working with the phage X174 showed that they could possess single stranded DNA genomes.&lt;ref name=Sinshemer1959a&gt;Sinshemer RL (1959) J Mol Biol 1:37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinshemer1959b&gt;Sinshemer RL (1959) J Mol Biol 1:43&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this discovery until relatively recently it was believed that the majority of DNA viruses belonged to the double stranded clade. Recent work suggests that this may not be the case with single stranded viruses forming the majority of viruses found in sea water, fresh water, [[sediment]], terrestrial, extreme, [[metazoa]]n-associated and marine microbial mats.&lt;ref name=Desnues2008&gt;Desnues C, Rodriguez-Brito B, Rayhawk S, Kelley S, Tran T, Haynes M, Liu H, Furlan M, Wegley L, Chau B, Ruan Y, Hall D, Angly FE, Edwards RA, Li L, Thurber RV, Reid RP, Siefert J, Souza V, Valentine DL, Swan BK, Breitbart M, Rohwer F (2008) Biodiversity and biogeography of phages in modern stromatolites and thrombolites.Nature 452(7185):340-343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&gt;Angly FE, Felts B, Breitbart M, Salamon P, Edwards RA, Carlson C, Chan AM, Haynes M, Kelley S, Liu H, Mahaffy JM, Mueller JE, Nulton J, Olson R, Parsons R, Rayhawk S, Suttle CA, Rohwer F (2006) The marine viromes of four oceanic regions. PLoS Biol 4(11):e368.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these viruses have yet to be classified and assigned to genera and higher taxa. Because most of these viruses do not appear to be related or are only distantly related to known viruses additional taxa will be created for these.

All viruses in this group require formation of a replicative form - a double stranded DNA intermediate - for genome replication. This is normally created from the viral DNA with the assistance of the host's own [[DNA polymerase]]. 

The evolutionary history of this group is currently poorly understood. However the parvoviruses have frequently invaded the germ lines of diverse animal species including [[mammal]]s, [[fish]]es, [[bird]]s, [[tunicate]]s, [[arthropod]]s and [[flatworm]]s.&lt;ref name=Belyi2010&gt;Belyi VA, Levine AJ, Skalka AM (2010) Sequences from ancestral single-stranded DNA viruses in vertebrate genomes: the parvoviridae and circoviridae are more than 40 to 50 million years old. J Virol 84(23):12458-12462&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Liu2011&gt;Liu H, Fu Y, Xie J, Cheng J, Ghabrial SA, Li G, Peng Y, Yi X, Jiang D. (2011) Widespread endogenization of Densoviruses and Parvoviruses in animal and human genomes. J Virol 85(19):9863-9876&lt;/ref&gt; In particular they have been associated with the human genome for ~98 million years.     

===Host range===

Families in this group have been assigned on the basis of the nature of the genome (circular or linear) and the host range. Eight families are currently recognised.

The family ''Parvoviridae'' all have linear genomes while the other families have circular genomes. The ''Inoviridae'' and ''Microviridae'' infect [[bacteria]]; the ''Anelloviridae'' and ''Circoviridae'' infect [[animal]]s ([[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s respectively); and the ''Geminiviridae'' and ''Nanoviridae'' infect [[plant]]s. In both the ''Geminiviridae'' and ''Nanoviridae'' the genome is composed of more than a single chromosome. The ''Bacillariodnaviridae'' infect [[diatom]]s and have a unique genome: the major chromosome is circular (~6 kilobases in length): the minor chromosome is linear (~1 kilobase in length) and complementary to part of the major chromosome.

===Taxonomy===

** Family ''[[Anelloviridae]]''
** Family ''[[Bacillariodnaviridae]]''
** Family ''[[Circoviridae]]''
** Family ''[[Geminiviridae]]''
** Family ''[[Inoviridae]]''
** Family ''[[Microviridae]]''
** Family ''[[Nanoviridae]]''
** Family ''[[Parvoviridae]]'' - includes [[Parvovirus B19]]

===Unassigned species===

A number of additional single stranded DNA viruses are known but are as yet unclassified. Among these are the parvovirus like viruses. These have linear single stranded DNA genomes but unlike the parvoviruses the genome is bipartate. This group includes the [[Bombyx mori densovirus type 2]], [[Hepatopancreatic parvo-like virus]] and [[Lymphoidal parvo-like virus]]. A new family ''[[Bidensoviridae]]'' has been proposed for this group but this proposal has not been ratified by the [[ICTV]] to date.&lt;ref name=Tijssen1995&gt;Tijssen P, Bergoin M (1995) Densonucleosis viruses constitute an increasingly diversified subfamily among the parvoviruses. Seminars in Virology 6, 347-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Their closest relations appear to be the ''[[Brevidensoviruses]]'' (family ''Parvoviridae'').&lt;ref name=Sukhumsirichart2006&gt;Sukhumsirichart W, Attasart P, Boonsaeng V, Panyim S (2006) Complete nucleotide sequence and genomic organization of hepatopancreatic parvovirus (HPV) of ''Penaeus monodon''. Virology 346(2):266-277&lt;/ref&gt;

Another new genus - as yet unnamed - has been proposed.&lt;ref name=Kim2011&gt;Kim HK, Park SJ, Nguyen VG, Song DS, Moon HJ, Kang BK, Park BK (2011) Identification of a novel single stranded circular DNA virus from bovine stool. J Gen Virol &lt;/ref&gt; This genus includes the species [[bovine stool associated circular virus]] and [[chimpanzee stool associated circular virus]].&lt;ref name=Blinkova2010&gt;Blinkova O, Victoria J, Li Y, Keele BF, Sanz C, Ndjango JB, Peeters M, Travis D, Lonsdorf EV, Wilson ML, Pusey AE, Hahn BH, Delwart EL (2010) Novel circular DNA viruses in stool samples of wild-living chimpanzees. J Gen Virol 91(Pt 1):74-86&lt;/ref&gt; The closest relations to this genus appear to be the ''Nanoviridae'' but further work will be needed to confirm this.

A virus with a circular genome - [[sea turtle tornovirus 1]] - has been isolated from a sea turtle with [[fibropapillomatosis]].&lt;ref name=Ng2009&gt;Ng TF, Manire C, Borrowman K, Langer T, Ehrhart L, Breitbart M (2009) Discovery of a novel single-stranded DNA virus from a sea turtle fibropapilloma by using viral metagenomics. J Virol 83(6):2500-2509&lt;/ref&gt; It is sufficiently unrelated to any other known virus that it may belong to a new family. The closest relations seem to be the ''Gyrovirinae''. The proposed genus name for this virus is [[Tornovirus]]. 

Although ~50 archaeal viruses are known all the DNA viruses infecting archaea, with one known exception, have double stranded genomes. This exception is the [[Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1]] which has a unique structure and a circular genome.&lt;ref name=Pietilä2010&gt;Pietilä MK, Laurinavicius S, Sund J, Roine E, Bamford DH (2010) The single-stranded DNA genome of novel archaeal virus Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 is enclosed in the envelope decorated with glycoprotein spikes. J Virol 84(2):788-798&lt;/ref&gt;

Most known fungal viruses have either double stranded DNA or RNA genomes. A single stranded DNA fungal virus - [[Sclerotinia sclerotiorum hypovirulence associated DNA virus 1]] - has been described.&lt;ref name=Yu2010&gt;Yu X, Li B, Fu Y, Jiang D, Ghabrial SA, Li G, Peng Y, Xie J, Cheng J, Huang J, Yi X (2010) A geminivirus-related DNA mycovirus that confers hypovirulence to a plant pathogenic fungus. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107(18):8387-8392&lt;/ref&gt; This virus appears to be related to the ''Geminiviridae'' but is distinct from them.

An unusual - and as yet unnamed - virus has been isolated from the flatwom ''[[Girardia tigrina]]''.&lt;ref name=Rebrikov2002&gt;Rebrikov DV, Bulina ME, Bogdanova EA, Vagner LL, Lukyanov SA (2002) Complete genome sequence of a novel extrachromosomal virus-like element identified in planarian ''Girardia tigrina''. BMC Genomics 13;3:15.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its genome organisation, this virus appears to belong to an entirely new family. It is the first virus to be isolated from a [[flatworm]].

==Satellite viruses==

Satellite viruses are small viruses with either RNA or DNA as their genomic material that require another virus to replicate. There are two types of DNA satellite viruses - the [[alphasatellite]]s and the [[betasatellite]]s - both of which are dependent on begomaviruses. At present satellite viruses are not classified into genera or higher taxa. 

Alphasatellites are small circular single strand DNA viruses that require a [[begomovirus]] for transmission. Betasatellites are small linear single stranded DNA viruses that require a begomovirus to replicate.

==Notes==

=== NCLDVs===
{{main|Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses}}
The asfarviruses, iridoviruses, mimiviruses, phycodnaviruses and poxviruses have been shown to belong to a single group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iyer2006&quot;&gt;Iyer LM, Balaji S, Koonin EV, Aravind L (2006) Evolutionary genomics of nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses. Virus Res. 117(1):156-184&lt;/ref&gt; - the large nuclear and cytoplasmic DNA viruses. These are also abbreviated &quot;NCLDV&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20017929&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yutin N, Wolf YI, Raoult D, Koonin EV |title=Eukaryotic large nucleo-cytoplasmic DNA viruses: clusters of orthologous genes and reconstruction of viral genome evolution |journal=Virol. J. |volume=6 |issue= |pages=223 |year=2009 |pmid=20017929 |pmc=2806869 |doi=10.1186/1743-422X-6-223 |url=http://www.virologyj.com/content/6//223}}&lt;/ref&gt; This clade can be divided into two groups:

* the iridoviruses-phycodnaviruses-mimiviruses group. The phycodnaviruses and mimiviruses are sister clades.
* the poxvirus-asfarviruses group.

It is probable that these viruses evolved before the separation of eukaryoyes into the extant crown groups. The ancestral genome was complex with at least 41 genes including (1) the replication machinery (2) up to four [[RNA polymerase]] subunits (3) at least three [[transcription factor]]s (4) capping and polyadenylation enzymes (5) the DNA packaging apparatus (6) and structural components of an icosahedral capsid and the viral membrane.

===Bacteriophage evolution===

Bacteriophages occur in over 140 bacterial or archaeal genera.&lt;ref name=Ackermann2003&gt;Ackermann HW (2003) Bacteriophage observations and evolution. Res Microbiol 154(4):245-251&lt;/ref&gt; They arose repeatedly in different hosts and there are at least 11 separate lines of descent. Over 5100 bacteriophages have been examined in the electron microscope since 1959. Of these at least 4950 phages (96%) have tails. Of the tailed phages 61% have long, noncontractile tails (''Siphoviridae''). Tailed phages appear to be monophyletic and are the oldest known virus group.

===Phylogenetic relationships===

The family ''Ascoviridae'' appear to have evolved from the ''Iridoviridae''.&lt;ref name=Federici2009&gt;Federici BA, Bideshi DK, Tan Y, Spears T, Bigot Y (2009) Ascoviruses: superb manipulators of apoptosis for viral replication and transmission. Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 328:171-196. &lt;/ref&gt; The family ''Polydnaviridae'' may have evolved from the ''Ascoviridae''. Molecular evidence suggests that the ''Phycodnaviridae''  may have evolved from the family ''Iridoviridae''.&lt;ref name=Wilson2009&gt;Wilson WH, Van Etten JL, Allen MJ (2009) The Phycodnaviridae: the story of how tiny giants rule the world. Curr Top Microbiol Immunol 328:1-42&lt;/ref&gt; These four families (''Ascoviridae'', ''Iridoviridae'', ''Phycodnaviridae'' and ''Polydnaviridae'') may form a clade but more work is needed to confirm this.  

Based on the genome organisation and DNA replication mechanism it seems that phylogenetic relationships may exist between the rudiviruses (''Rudiviridae'') and the large eukaryal DNA viruses: the African swine fever virus (''Asfarviridae''), Chlorella viruses (''Phycodnaviridae'') and poxviruses (''Poxviridae'').&lt;ref name=Prangishvili2004&gt;Prangishvili D, Garrett RA (2004) Exceptionally diverse morphotypes and genomes of crenarchaeal hyperthermophilic viruses. Biochem Soc Trans 32(Pt 2):204-208&lt;/ref&gt;

The nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus group (''Asfarviridae'', ''Iridoviridae'', ''Marseilleviridae'', ''Mimiviridae'', ''Phycodnaviridae'' and ''Poxviridae'') along with three other families - ''Adenoviridae'', ''Cortiviridae'' and ''Tectiviridae'' - and the phage Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus and the satellite virus Sputnik all possess double β-barrel major capsid proteins suggesting a common origin.&lt;ref name=Krupovi2010&gt;Krupovi M, Bamford DH (2008) Virus evolution: how far does the double beta-barrel viral lineage extend? Nat. Rev. Microbiol 6:941-948&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the analysis of the DNA polymerase the genus ''Dinodnavirus'' may be a member of the family ''Asfarviridae''.&lt;ref name=Ogata2009&gt;Ogata H, Toyoda K, Tomaru Y, Nakayama N, Shirai Y, Claverie JM, Nagasaki K (2009) Remarkable sequence similarity between the dinoflagellate-infecting marine girus and the terrestrial pathogen African swine fever virus. Virol J 6:178&lt;/ref&gt; Further work on this virus will required before a final assignment can be made.

The families ''Adenoviridae'' and ''Tectiviridae'' appear to be related structurally.&lt;ref name=Benson1999&gt;Benson SD, Bamford JK, Bamford DH, Burnett RM (1999) Viral evolution revealed by bacteriophage PRD1 and human adenovirus coat protein structures. Cell 98(6):825-833.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the analysis of the coat protein ''Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus'' may share a common ancestry with the ''Tectiviridae''.

A protein common to the families ''Bicaudaviridae'', ''Lipotrixviridae'' and ''Rudiviridae'' and the unclassified virus Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus is known suggesting a common origin.&lt;ref name=Keller2007&gt;Keller J, Leulliot N, Cambillau C, Campanacci V, Porciero S, Prangishvilli D, Forterre P, Cortez D, Quevillon-Cheruel S, van Tilbeurgh H (2007) Crystal structure of AFV3-109, a highly conserved protein from crenarchaeal viruses. Virol J 22;4:12&lt;/ref&gt;

Examination of the ''pol'' genes that encode the DNA dependent [[DNA polymerase]] in various groups of viruses suggests a number of possible evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref name=Knopf1998&gt;Knopf CW (1998) Evolution of viral DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. Virus Genes 16(1):47-58&lt;/ref&gt; All know viral DNA polymerases belong to the DNA ''pol'' families A and B. All possess a 3'-5'-[[exonuclease]] domain with three sequence motifs Exo I, Exo II and Exo III. The families A and B are distinguishable with family A Pol sharing 9 distinct consensus sequences and only two of them are convincingly homologous to sequence motif B of family B. The putative sequence motifs A, B, and C of the polymerase domain are located near the C-terminus in family A Pol and more central in family B Pol. 

Phylogenetic analysis of these genes places the adenoviruses (''Adenoviridae''), bacteriophages (''Caudovirales'') and the plant and fungal linear plasmids into a single clade. A second clade includes the  alpha- and delta-like viral Pol from insect ascovirus (''Ascoviridae''), mammalian herpesviruses (''Herpesviridae''), fish lymphocystis disease virus (''Iridoviridae'') and chlorella virus (''Phycoviridae''). The ''pol'' genes of the African swine fever virus (''Asfarviridae''), baculoviruses (''Baculoviridae''), fish herpesvirus (''Herpesviridae''), T-even bacteriophages (''Myoviridae'') and poxviruses (''Poxviridae'') were not clearly resolved. A second study showed that poxvirus, baculovirus and the animal herpesviruses form separate and distinct clades.&lt;ref name=Villarreal2000&gt;Villarreal LP, DeFilippis VR (2000) A hypothesis for DNA viruses as the origin of eukaryotic replication proteins. J Virol 74(15):7079-7084&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship to the ''Asfarviridae'' and the ''Myoviridae'' was not examined and remains unclear.  

The polymerases from the archaea are similar to family B DNA Pols. The T4-like viruses infect both bacteria and archaea&lt;ref name=Zillig1996&gt;Zillig W, Prangishvilli D, Schleper C, Elferink M, Holz I, Albers S, Janekovic D, Götz D (1996) Viruses, plasmids and other genetic elements of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic Archaea. FEMS Microbiol Rev 18(2-3):225-236&lt;/ref&gt; and their ''pol'' gene resembles that of [[eukaryote]]s. The DNA polymerase of [[mitochondria]] resembles that of the T odd phages (''Myoviridae'').&lt;ref name=Shutt2005&gt;Shutt TE, Gray MW (2005) Bacteriophage origins of mitochondrial replication and transcription proteins. Trends Genet 22(2):90-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a single gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of the [[terminase]] is conserved among all herpesviruses. To a lesser extent this gene is also found also in [[T4-like]] [[bacteriophages]] suggesting a common ancestor for these two groups of viruses.&lt;ref name=Davison2002&gt;Davison AJ (2002) Evolution of the herpesviruses. Vet Microbiol 22;86(1-2):69-88&lt;/ref&gt;

A common origin for the Herpesviruses and the Caudoviruses has been suggested on the basis of parallels in their capsid assembly pathways and similarities between their portal complexes, through which DNA enters the capsid. &lt;ref name=Baker2005&gt;Baker ML, Jiang W, Rixon FJ, Chiu W (2005) Common ancestry of herpesviruses and tailed DNA bacteriophages. J. Virol. 79:14967-14970&lt;/ref&gt; These two groups of viruses share a distinctive 12-fold arrangement of subunits in the portal complex.

Baculoviruses evolved from with the Nudiviruses {{ma|310}}.&lt;ref name=Thézé2011&gt;Thézé J, Bézier A, Periquet G, Drezen JM, Herniou EA (2011) Paleozoic origin of insect large dsDNA viruses. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 108(38):15931-15935&lt;/ref&gt;

Circoviruses may have evolved from a nanovirus.&lt;ref name=Gibbs1999&gt;Gibbs MJ, Weiller GF (1999) Evidence that a plant virus switched hosts to infect a vertebrate and then recombined with a vertebrate-infecting virus. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96(14):8022-8027&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the similarities between the ''rep'' proteins of the alphasatellites and the nanoviruses, it is likely that the alphasatellites evolved from the nanoviruses.&lt;ref name=Xie2010&gt;Xie Y, Wu P, Liu P, Gong H, Zhou X (2010) Characterization of alphasatellites associated with monopartite begomovirus/betasatellite complexes in Yunnan, China. Virol J 7:178&lt;/ref&gt; Further work in this area is needed to clarify this.

[[Image:DNA replication split.svg|thumb|200px|right|DNA replication. The [[double helix]] is unwound and each strand acts as a template for the next strand. [[Nucleotides|Bases]] are matched to synthesize the new partner strands.]]
'''DNA replication''' is a biological process that occurs in all [[life on Earth|living organisms]] and copies their [[DNA]]; it is the basis for [[heredity|biological inheritance]]. The process starts with one double-stranded DNA molecule and produces two identical copies of the molecule. Each strand of the original double-stranded DNA molecule serves as template for the production of the complementary strand, a process referred to as [[semiconservative replication]]. Cellular [[Proofreading (Biology)|proofreading]] and error toe-checking mechanisms ensure [[Mutation|near perfect]] fidelity for DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[cell (biology)|cell]], DNA replication begins at specific locations in the genome, called &quot;[[origin of replication|origins]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author= Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L, Clarke ND| title=Biochemistry| year=2002| publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company| isbn=0-7167-3051-0}}[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bofghoks/bv.fcvbngi?rid=stryer.section.3794 Chapter 27, Section 4: DNA Replication of Both Strands Proceeds Rapidly from Specific Start Sites]
&lt;/ref&gt; Unwinding of DNA at the origin, and synthesis of new strands, forms a [[replication fork]]. In addition to [[DNA polymerase]], the [[enzyme]] that synthesizes the new DNA by adding [[nucleotides]] matched to the template strand, a number of other [[protein]]s are associated with the fork and assist in the initiation and continuation of DNA synthesis.

DNA replication can also be performed ''[[in vitro]]'' (artificially, outside a cell). [[DNA polymerases]], isolated from cells, and artificial DNA primers are used to initiate DNA synthesis at known sequences in a template molecule. The [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), a common laboratory technique, employs such artificial synthesis in a cyclic manner to amplify a specific target DNA fragment from a pool of DNA.

==DNA structure==
{{Main|DNA structure}}[[File:DNA replication.theora.ogv|right|200px]]
[[Image:DNA chemical structure.svg|thumb|200px|right|The chemical structure of DNA]]
DNA usually exists as a double-stranded structure, with both strands coiled together to form the characteristic [[double-helix]]. Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of [[nucleotide]]s having the bases: [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], and [[thymine]]. A nucleotide is a mono-, di-, or triphosphate deoxyribonucleoside; that is, a deoxyribose sugar is attached to one, two, or three phosphates. Chemical interaction of these nucleotides forms [[phosphodiester bonds|phosphodiester linkages]], creating the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone of the DNA double helix with the bases pointing inward. Nucleotides (bases) are matched between strands through [[hydrogen bonding|hydrogen bonds]] to form [[base pair]]s. Adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine pairs with guanine.

DNA strands have a directionality, and the different ends of a single strand are called the &quot;3' (three-prime) end&quot; and the &quot;5' (five-prime) end&quot; with the direction of the naming going 5  prime to the 3 prime region. The strands of the helix are anti-parallel with one being 5 prime to 3 then the opposite strand 3 prime to 5. These terms refer to the carbon atom in deoxyribose to which the next phosphate in the chain attaches. Directionality has consequences in DNA synthesis, because DNA polymerase can synthesize DNA in only one direction by adding nucleotides to the 3' end of a DNA strand.

The pairing of bases in DNA through hydrogen bonding means that the information contained within each strand is redundant. The nucleotides on a single strand can be used to reconstruct nucleotides on a newly synthesized partner strand.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts, B., et.al., ''Molecular Biology of the Cell,'' Garland Science, 4th ed., 2002, pp. 238-240 ISBN 0-8153-3218-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA polymerase==
{{Main|DNA polymerase}}

[[Image:DNA polymerase.svg|thumb|250px|right| DNA polymerases adds nucleotides to the 5' end of a strand of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Lizabeth A. ''Fundamental Molecular Biology''. Blackwell Publishing. 2007. p.112 ISBN 978-1-4051-0379-4&lt;/ref&gt; If a mismatch is accidentally incorporated, the polymerase is inhibited from further extension. Proofreading removes the mismatched nucleotide and extension continues.]]

[[DNA polymerase]]s are a family of [[enzyme]]s that carry out all forms of DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L, Clarke ND| title=Biochemistry| year=2002| publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company| isbn=0-7167-3051-0}} [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=stryer.section.3769 Chapter 27, Section 2: DNA Polymerases Require a Template and a Primer]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a DNA polymerase can only extend an existing DNA strand paired with a template strand; it cannot begin the synthesis of a new strand. To begin synthesis, a short fragment of DNA or [[RNA]], called a [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]], must be created and paired with the template DNA strand.

DNA polymerase then synthesizes a new strand of DNA by extending the 3' end of an existing nucleotide chain, adding new [[nucleotide]]s matched to the template strand one at a time via the creation of [[phosphodiester bond]]s. The energy for this process of DNA polymerization comes from two of the three total phosphates attached to each unincorporated [[nucleotide|base]]. (Free bases with their attached phosphate groups are called [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s.) When a nucleotide is being added to a growing DNA strand, two of the phosphates are removed and the energy produced creates a phosphodiester bond that attaches the remaining phosphate to the growing chain. The [[energetics]] of this process also help explain the directionality of synthesis - if DNA were synthesized in the 3' to 5' direction, the energy for the process would come from the 5' end of the growing strand rather than from free nucleotides.

In general, DNA polymerases are extremely accurate, making less than one mistake for every 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; nucleotides added.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18166979&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=McCulloch SD, Kunkel TA |title=The fidelity of DNA synthesis by eukaryotic replicative and translesion synthesis polymerases |journal=Cell Research |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=148–61 |year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18166979 |doi=10.1038/cr.2008.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Even so, some DNA polymerases also have proofreading ability; they can remove nucleotides from the end of a strand in order to correct mismatched bases. If the 5' nucleotide needs to be removed during proofreading, the triphosphate end is lost. Hence, the energy source that usually provides energy to add a new nucleotide is also lost.

===Origins ===
For a cell to divide, it must first replicate its DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P| title=Molecular Biology of the Cell | year=2002| publisher=Garland Science| isbn=0-8153-3218-1}} [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.754 Chapter 5: DNA Replication Mechanisms]&lt;/ref&gt; This process is initiated at particular points in the DNA, known as &quot;[[origin of replication|origin]]s&quot;, which are targeted by proteins that separate the two strands and initiate DNA synthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;/&gt; Origins contain DNA sequences recognized by replication initiator proteins (e.g., [[dnaA]] in ''[[E. coli]]''' and the [[Origin Recognition Complex]] in [[yeast]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weigel C, Schmidt A, Rückert B, Lurz R, Messer W |title=DnaA protein binding to individual DnaA boxes in the Escherichia coli replication origin, oriC |journal=The EMBO Journal |volume=16 |issue=21 |pages=6574–83 |year=1997 |month=November |pmid=9351837 |pmc=1170261 |doi=10.1093/emboj/16.21.6574}}&lt;/ref&gt; These initiator proteins recruit other proteins to separate the two strands and initiate replication forks.

Initiator proteins recruit other proteins and form the [[pre-replication complex]], which separate the DNA strands at the origin and forms a bubble. Origins tend to be &quot;AT-rich&quot; (rich in adenine and thymine bases) to assist this process, because A-T base pairs have two hydrogen bonds (rather than the three formed in a C-G pair)&amp;mdash;in general, strands rich in these nucleotides are easier to separate because a greater number of hydrogen bonds requires more energy to break them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky LS, Matsudaira P, Baltimore D, Darnell J| title=Molecular Cell Biology| year=2000| publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company| isbn=0-7167-3136-3}}[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mcb.section.3163#3179 12.1.  General Features of Chromosomal Replication: Three Common Features of Replication Origins]&lt;/ref&gt; 

All known DNA replication systems require a free 3' OH group before synthesis can be initiated (Important note: DNA is read in 3' to 5' direction whereas a new strand is synthesised in the 5' to 3' direction - this is entirely logical but is often confused). Four distinct mechanisms for synthesis have been described. 

1. All cellular life forms and many DNA [[virus|viruses]], [[phage|phages]] and [[plasmid|plasmids]] use a [[primase]] to synthesize a short RNA primer with a free 3′ OH group which is subsequently elongated by a DNA polymerase.  

2. The retroelements (including [[retrovirus]]es) employ a transfer RNA that primes DNA replication by providing a free 3′ OH that is used for elongation by the [[reverse transcriptase]]. 

3. In the [[adenovirus]]es and the [[φ29 family]] of [[bacteriophage]]s, the 3' OH group is provided by the side chain of an amino acid of the genome attached protein (the terminal protein) to which nucleotides are added by the DNA polymerase to form a new strand.  

4. In the single stranded DNA viruses - a group that includes the [[circovirus]]es, the [[geminivirus]]es, the [[parvovirus]]es and others - and also the many phages and [[plasmid]]s that use the rolling circle replication (RCR) mechanism, the RCR endonuclease creates a nick the genome strand (single stranded viruses) or one of the DNA strands (plasmids). The 5′ end of the nicked strand is transferred to a [[tyrosine]] residue on the nuclease and the free 3′ OH group is then used by the DNA polymerase for new strand synthesis.

The best known of these mechanisms is that used by the cellular organisms. In these once the two strands are separated, RNA primers are created on the template strands. To be more specific, the leading strand receives one RNA primer per active origin of replication while the lagging strand receives several; these several fragments of RNA primers found on the lagging strand of DNA are called [[Okazaki fragments]], named after their discoverer. DNA polymerase extends the leading strand in one continuous motion and the lagging strand in a discontinuous motion (due to the Okazaki fragments). [[RNase]] removes the RNA fragments used to initiate replication by DNA polymerase, and another DNA Polymerase enters to fill the gaps. When this is complete, a single nick on the leading strand and several nicks on the lagging strand can be found. Ligase works to fill these nicks in, thus completing the newly replicated DNA molecule.

The primase used in this process differs significantly between [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]/[[eukaryote]]s. Bacteria use a primase belonging to the DnaG protein superfamily which contains a catalytic domain of the TOPRIM fold type. The TOPRIM fold contains an α/β core with four conserved strands in a Rossmann-like topology. This structure is also found in the catalytic domains of [[topoisomerase]] Ia, topoisomerase II, the OLD-family nucleases and DNA repair proteins related to the RecR protein. 

The primase used by archaea and eukaryotes in contrast contains a highly derived version of the RNA recognition motif (RRM). This primase is structurally similar to many viral RNA dependent RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, cyclic nucleotide generating cyclases and DNA polymerases of the A/B/Y families that are involved in DNA replication and repair. All these proteins share a catalytic mechanism of di-metal-ion-mediated nucleotide transfer, whereby two acidic residues located at the end of the first strand and between the second and third strands of the RRM-like unit respectively, chelate two divalent [[cation]]s. 

As DNA synthesis continues, the original DNA strands continue to unwind on each side of the bubble, forming a [[replication fork]] with two prongs. In bacteria, which have a single origin of replication on their circular chromosome, this process eventually creates a &quot;[[theta structure]]&quot; (resembling the Greek letter theta: θ). In contrast, eukaryotes have longer linear chromosomes and initiate replication at multiple origins within these.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Replication fork===
[[Image:DNA replication en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Many enzymes are involved in the DNA replication fork.]]
{{Main|Replication fork}}
The replication fork is a structure that forms within the nucleus during DNA replication. It is created by helicases, which break the hydrogen bonds holding the two DNA strands together. The resulting structure has two branching &quot;prongs&quot;, each one made up of a single strand of DNA. These two strands serve as the template for the leading and lagging strands, which will be created as DNA polymerase matches complementary nucleotides to the templates; The templates may be properly referred to as the leading strand template and the lagging strand template.

====Leading strand====
The leading strand is the template strand of the DNA double helix so that the replication fork moves along it in the 3' to 5' direction.  This allows the newly synthesized strand complementary to the original strand to be synthesized 5' to 3' in the same direction as the movement of the replication fork. 

On the leading strand, a polymerase &quot;reads&quot; the DNA and adds [[nucleotides]] to it continuously. This polymerase is [[DNA polymerase III]] (DNA Pol III) in [[prokaryotes]] and presumably [[Pol ε]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Pursell, Z.F. et al. | year=2007 | title= Yeast DNA Polymerase ε Participates in Leading-Strand DNA Replication | journal=Science | volume= 317 | pages= 127–130 | pmid=17615360 | doi=10.1126/science.1144067| issue=5834| pmc=2233713}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18166979&quot; /&gt; in yeasts.  In human cells the leading and lagging strands are synthesized by Pol α and Pol δ within the nucleus and Pol γ in the mitochondria.  Pol ε can substitute for Pol δ in special circumstances&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaplan Biochem&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=Barbara|title=Biochemistry and Medical Genetics: Lecture Notes|year=2011|publisher=Kaplan Medical|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Lagging strand====
The lagging strand is the strand of the template DNA double helix that is oriented so that the replication fork moves along it in a 5' to 3' manner. Because of its orientation, opposite to the working orientation of DNA polymerase III, which moves on a template in a 3' to 5' manner, replication of the lagging strand is more complicated than that of the leading strand.

On the lagging strand, [[primase]] &quot;reads&quot; the DNA and adds [[RNA]] to it in short, separated segments. In eukaryotes, primase is intrinsic to [[Polymerase (DNA directed), alpha 1|Pol α]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Elizabeth R. Barry; Stephen D.

UR only until January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In prokaryotes, [[DNA polymerase I]] &quot;reads&quot; the fragments, removes the RNA using its [[flap endonuclease]] domain (RNA primers are removed by 5'-3' exonuclease activity of polymerase I [weaver, 2005], and replaces the RNA nucleotides with DNA nucleotides (this is necessary because RNA and DNA use slightly different kinds of nucleotides). [[DNA ligase]] joins the fragments together.

====Dynamics at the replication fork====
[[Image:1axc tricolor.png|thumb|200px|The assembled human DNA clamp, a [[trimer (biochemistry)|trimer]] of the protein [[PCNA]].]]
As helicase unwinds DNA at the replication fork, the DNA ahead is forced to rotate. This process results in a build-up of twists in the DNA ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P| title=Molecular Biology of the Cell | year=2002| publisher=Garland Science| isbn=0-8153-3218-1}} [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.754#787 DNA Replication Mechanisms: DNA Topoisomerases Prevent DNA Tangling During Replication]&lt;/ref&gt;    This build-up would form a resistance that would eventually halt the progress of the replication fork. DNA Gyrase is an enzyme that temporarily breaks the strands of DNA, relieving the tension caused by unwinding the two strands of the DNA helix; DNA Gyrase achieves this by adding negative supercoils to the DNA helix. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1657531&lt;/ref&gt;

Bare single-stranded DNA tends to fold back on itself and form [[Secondary structure#Nucleic acids|secondary structures]]; these structures can interfere with the movement of DNA polymerase. To prevent this, [[single-strand binding protein]]s bind to the DNA until a second strand is synthesized, preventing secondary structure formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P| title=Molecular Biology of the Cell | year=2002| publisher=Garland Science| isbn=0-8153-3218-1}} [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.754#774 DNA Replication Mechanisms: Special Proteins Help to Open Up the DNA Double Helix in Front of the Replication Fork]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DNA clamp|Clamp proteins]] form a sliding clamp around DNA, helping the DNA polymerase maintain contact with its template, thereby assisting with processivity. The inner face of the clamp enables DNA to be threaded through it. Once the polymerase reaches the end of the template or detects double-stranded DNA, the sliding clamp undergoes a conformational change that releases the DNA polymerase. Clamp-loading proteins are used to initially load the clamp, recognizing the junction between template and RNA primers.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Regulation===
[[Image:Cell Cycle 2.png|thumb|150px|The cell cycle of eukaryotic cells.]]
;Eukaryotes

Within eukaryotes, DNA replication is controlled within the context of the [[cell cycle]]. As the cell grows and divides, it progresses through stages in the cell cycle; DNA replication occurs during the S phase (synthesis phase). The progress of the eukaryotic cell through the cycle is controlled by [[cell cycle checkpoint]]s. Progression through checkpoints is controlled through complex interactions between various proteins, including [[cyclin]]s and [[cyclin-dependent kinase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P| title=Molecular Biology of the Cell | year=2002| publisher=Garland Science| isbn=0-8153-3218-1}} [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.section.3214#3215 Intracellular Control of Cell-Cycle Events: S-Phase Cyclin-Cdk Complexes (S-Cdks) Initiate DNA Replication Once Per Cycle]&lt;/ref&gt;

The G1/S checkpoint (or restriction checkpoint) regulates whether eukaryotic cells enter the process of DNA replication and subsequent division. Cells that do not proceed through this checkpoint are remain in the G0 stage and do not replicate their DNA.

Replication of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes occurs independent of the cell cycle, through the process of [[D-loop replication]].

;Bacteria

Most bacteria do not go through a well-defined cell cycle but instead continuously copy their DNA; during rapid growth, this can result in the concurrent occurrences of multiple rounds of replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Obligate Human Pathogen, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Is Polyploid| author=Tobiason DM, Seifert HS| journal=PLoS Biology| year=2006| volume=4| issue=6| doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040185| pages=e185| pmid=16719561| pmc=1470461}}&lt;/ref&gt;    In ''E. coli'', the best-characterized bacteria, DNA replication is regulated through several mechanisms, including: the hemimethylation and sequestering of the origin sequence, the ratio of ATP to ADP, and the levels of protein DnaA. All these control the process of initiator proteins binding to the origin sequences.

Because ''E. coli'' [[DNA methylation|methylates]] GATC DNA sequences, DNA synthesis results in hemimethylated sequences. This hemimethylated DNA is recognized by the protein SeqA, which binds and sequesters the origin sequence; in addition, dnaA (required for initiation of replication) binds less well to hemimethylated DNA. As a result, newly replicated origins are prevented from immediately initiating another round of DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Slater S, Wold S, Lu M, Boye E, Skarstad K, Kleckner N |title=E. coli SeqA protein binds oriC in two different methyl-modulated reactions appropriate to its roles in DNA replication initiation and origin sequestration |journal=Cell |volume=82 |issue=6 |pages=927–36 |year=1995 |month=September |pmid=7553853 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(95)90272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATP builds up when the cell is in a rich medium, triggering DNA replication once the cell has reached a specific size. ATP competes with ADP to bind to DnaA, and the DnaA-ATP complex is able to initiate replication. A certain number of DnaA proteins are also required for DNA replication &amp;mdash; each time the origin is copied, the number of binding sites for DnaA doubles, requiring the synthesis of more DnaA to enable another initiation of replication.

===Termination ===

Eukaryotes initiate DNA replication at multiple points in the chromosome, so replication forks meet and terminate at many points in the chromosome; these are not known to be regulated in any particular way. Because eukaryotes have linear chromosomes, DNA replication is unable to reach the very end of the chromosomes, but ends at the [[telomere]] region of repetitive DNA close to the end. This shortens the telomere of the daughter DNA strand. This is a normal process in [[somatic cell]]s. As a result, cells can only divide a certain number of times before the DNA loss prevents further division. (This is known as the [[Hayflick limit]].)  Within the [[germ cell]] line, which passes DNA to the next generation, [[telomerase]] extends the repetitive sequences of the telomere region to prevent degradation. Telomerase can become mistakenly active in somatic cells, sometimes leading to [[cancer]] formation.

Because bacteria have circular chromosomes, termination of replication occurs when the two replication forks meet each other on the opposite end of the parental chromosome. ''E coli'' regulate this process through the use of termination sequences that, when bound by the [[Tus protein]], enable only one direction of replication fork to pass through. As a result, the replication forks are constrained to always meet within the termination region of the chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= TA Brown| title=Genomes| year=2002| publisher=[[BIOS Scientific Publishers]]| isbn=1-85996-228-9}}[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=genomes.section.8121#8156 13.2.3.  Termination of replication]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polymerase chain reaction==
{{Main|Polymerase chain reaction}}
Researchers commonly replicate DNA ''in vitro'' using the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR). PCR uses a pair of [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] to span a target region in template DNA, and then polymerizes partner strands in each direction from these primers using a thermostable [[DNA polymerase]]. Repeating this process through multiple cycles produces amplification of the targeted DNA region. At the start of each cycle, the mixture of template and primers is heated, separating the newly synthesized molecule and template. Then, as the mixture cools, both of these become templates for annealing of new primers, and the polymerase extends from these. As a result, the number of copies of the target region doubles each round, [[exponential growth|increasing exponentially]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Saiki2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last=Saiki| first= RK| coauthors= Gelfand DH, Stoffel S, Scharf SJ, Higuchi R, Horn GT, Mullis KB, Erlich HA | url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/ebind2html/pcr/009| title= Primer-directed enzymatic amplification of DNA with a thermostable DNA polymerase| journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]| year= 1988| volume=239| pages= 487&amp;ndash;91| doi= 10.1126/science.2448875| pmid= 2448875| issue=4839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26278">In [[genetics]], '''noncoding DNA''' describes components of an organism's [[DNA]] sequences that do not [[genetic code|encode]] for [[protein]] sequences. In many [[eukaryote]]s, a large percentage of an organism's total [[genome size]] is noncoding DNA, although the amount of noncoding DNA, and the proportion of coding versus noncoding DNA varies greatly between species.

Much of this DNA has no known biological function and is sometimes referred to as &quot;'''junk DNA'''&quot;. However, many types of noncoding DNA sequences do have known biological functions, including the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]al and [[translation (biology)|translational]]    [[regulatory sequence|regulation]] of protein-coding sequences. Other noncoding sequences have likely, but as-yet undetermined, functions (this is inferred from high levels of [[homology (biology)|homology]] and [[Conserved sequence|conservation]] seen in sequences that do not encode proteins but, nonetheless,  
appear to be under heavy [[selective pressure]]). While this indicates that noncoding DNA should not be indiscriminately referred to as junk DNA, the lack of sequence conservation in a majority of noncoding DNA with no known function indicates that much of it may indeed be without function.

== Fraction of noncoding genomic DNA ==
The amount of total genomic DNA varies widely between organisms, and the proportion of coding and noncoding DNA within these genomes varies greatly as well. More than 98% of the [[human genome]] does not encode protein sequences, including most sequences within [[intron]]s and most [[intergenic region|intergenic DNA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elgar &amp; Vavouri&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elgar G, Vavouri T |title=Tuning in to the signals: noncoding sequence conservation in vertebrate genomes |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=24 |issue=7 |pages=344–52 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18514361 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2008.04.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While overall [[genome size]], and by extension the amount of noncoding DNA, are correlated to organism complexity, there are many exceptions. For example, the genome of the unicellular ''[[Polychaos dubium]]'' (formerly known as ''Amoeba dubia'') has been reported to contain more than 200 times the amount of DNA in humans.&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregory TR, Hebert PD |title=The modulation of DNA content: proximate causes and ultimate consequences |journal=Genome Res. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=317–24 |year=1999 |month=April |pmid=10207154 |doi= 10.1101/gr.9.4.317|url=http://www.genome.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10207154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pufferfish]] ''[[Takifugu]] rubripes'' genome is only about one eighth the size of the human genome, yet seems to have a comparable number of genes; approximately 90% of the ''Takifugu'' genome is noncoding DNA&lt;ref name=&quot;Elgar &amp; Vavouri&quot;/&gt; and most of the genome size difference appears to lie in the noncoding DNA. The extensive variation in nuclear genome size among eukaryotic species is known as the [[C-value enigma]] or C-value paradox.&lt;ref name=Wahls&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(90)90719-U | author=Wahls, W.P., ''et al.''| title=Hypervariable minisatellite DNA is a hotspot for homologous recombination in human cells | journal=Cell | year=1990 | pages=95–103 | volume=60| issue=1 | pmid=2295091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of noncoding DNA sequences==
{{main|conserved non-coding sequence}}

===Noncoding functional RNA===
[[Noncoding RNA]]s are functional [[RNA]] molecules that are not translated into protein. Examples of noncoding RNA include [[ribosomal RNA]], [[transfer RNA]], [[Piwi-interacting RNA]] and [[microRNA]].

MicroRNAs are predicted to control the translational activity of approximately 30% of all protein-coding genes in [[mammals]] and may be vital components in the progression or treatment of various diseases including [[cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and the [[immune system]] response to [[infection]].&lt;ref name=pmid19030926&gt;{{cite journal |author=Li M, Marin-Muller C, Bharadwaj U, Chow KH, Yao Q, Chen C |title=MicroRNAs: Control and Loss of Control in Human Physiology and Disease |journal=World J Surg |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=667–84 |year=2009 |month=April |pmid=19030926 |pmc=2933043 |doi=10.1007/s00268-008-9836-x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cis''- and ''Trans''-regulatory elements===
[[Cis-regulatory element]]s are sequences that control the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a nearby gene. Cis-elements may be located in [[5']] or [[3']] [[untranslated region]]s or within [[intron]]s. [[Trans-regulatory element]]s control the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a distant gene.

[[promoter (biology)|Promoter]]s facilitate the transcription of a particular gene and are typically [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|upstream]] of the coding region. [[Enhancer (genetics)|Enhancer]] sequences may also exert very distant effects on the transcription levels of genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Visel A, Rubin EM, [[Len A. Pennacchio|Pennacchio LA]] |title=Genomic Views of Distant-Acting Enhancers |journal=Nature |volume=461 |issue=7261 |pages=199–205 |year=2009 |month=September |pmid=19741700 |pmc=2923221 |doi=10.1038/nature08451 |url=|bibcode = 2009Natur.461..199V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introns===
[[Intron]]s are non-coding sections of a gene, transcribed into the [[precursor mRNA]] sequence, but ultimately removed by [[RNA splicing]] during the processing to mature [[messenger RNA]]. Many introns appear to be [[mobile genetic element]]s.&lt;ref name=intron/&gt;

Studies of [[group I intron]]s from ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' indicate that some introns appear to be selfish genetic elements, neutral to the host because they remove themselves from flanking [[exon]]s during [[RNA processing]] and do not produce an expression bias between [[allele]]s with and without the intron.&lt;ref name=intron&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nielsen H, Johansen SD |title=Group I introns: Moving in new directions |journal=RNA Biol |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=375–83 |year=2009 |pmid=19667762 |doi=10.4161/rna.6.4.9334 |url=http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/rna/abstract.php?id=9334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some introns appear to have significant biological function, possibly through [[ribozyme]] functionality that may regulate [[tRNA]] and [[rRNA]] activity as well as protein-coding gene expression, evident in hosts that have become dependent on such introns over long periods of time; for example, the ''trnL-intron'' is found in all [[green plant]]s and appears to have been [[Vertical gene transfer|vertically inherited]] for several billions of years, including more than a billion years within [[chloroplast]]s and an additional 2–3 billion years prior in the [[cyanobacteria]]l ancestors of chloroplasts.&lt;ref name=intron/&gt;

===Pseudogenes===
[[Pseudogene]]s are DNA sequences, related to known [[gene]]s, that have lost their protein-coding ability or are otherwise no longer [[Gene expression|expressed]] in the cell. Pseudogenes arise from retrotransposition or genomic duplication of functional genes, and become &quot;genomic fossils&quot; that are nonfunctional due to [[mutation]]s that prevent the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the gene, such as within the gene promoter region, or fatally alter the [[translation (biology)|translation]] of the gene, such as premature [[stop codon]]s or [[Translational frameshift|frameshift]]s.&lt;ref name=pmid17568002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zheng D, Frankish A, Baertsch R, ''et al.'' |title=Pseudogenes in the ENCODE regions: Consensus annotation, analysis of transcription, and evolution |journal=Genome Res. |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=839–51 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17568002 |pmc=1891343 |doi=10.1101/gr.5586307 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudogenes resulting from the retrotransposition of an RNA intermediate are known as processed pseudogenes; pseudogenes that arise from the genomic remains of [[gene duplication|duplicated genes]] or residues of inactivated genes are nonprocessed pseudogenes.&lt;ref name=pmid17568002/&gt;

While [[Dollo's Law]] suggests that the loss of function in pseudogenes is likely permanent, silenced genes may actually retain function for several million years and can be &quot;reactivated&quot; into protein-coding sequences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marshall CR, Raff EC, Raff RA |title=Dollo's law and the death and resurrection of genes |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=91 |issue=25 |pages=12283–7 |year=1994 |month=December |pmid=7991619 |pmc=45421 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.25.12283|bibcode = 1994PNAS...9112283M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a substantial number of pseudogenes are actively transcribed.&lt;ref name=pmid17568002/&gt; Because pseudogenes are presumed to change without evolutionary constraint, they can serve as a useful model of the type and frequencies of various spontaneous [[genetic mutation]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrov &amp; Hartl&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Petrov DA, Hartl DL |title=Pseudogene evolution and natural selection for a compact genome |journal=J. Hered. |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=221–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10833048 |doi= 10.1093/jhered/91.3.221|url=http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10833048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repeat sequences, transposons and viral elements===
[[Transposon]]s and [[retrotransposon]]s are [[mobile genetic elements]]. Retrotransposon [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repeated sequences]], which include [[Retrotransposon#LINEs|long interspersed nuclear elements]] (LINEs) and [[Retrotransposon#SINEs|short interspersed nuclear elements]] (SINEs), account for a large proportion of the genomic sequences in many species. [[Alu sequence]]s, classified as a short interspersed nuclear element, are the most abundant mobile elements in the human genome. Some examples have been found of SINEs exerting transcriptional control of some protein-encoding genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ponicsan SL, Kugel JF, Goodrich JA |title=Genomic gems: SINE RNAs regulate mRNA production |journal=Curr Opin Genet Dev |volume= 20|issue= 2|pages= 149–55|year=2010 |month=February |pmid=20176473 |pmc=2859989 |doi=10.1016/j.gde.2010.01.004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Häsler J, Samuelsson T, Strub K |title=Useful 'junk': Alu RNAs in the human transcriptome |journal=Cell.

Life Sci. |volume=64 |issue=14 |pages=1793–800 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17514354 |doi=10.1007/s00018-007-7084-0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walters RD, Kugel JF, Goodrich JA |title=InvAluable junk: the cellular impact and function of Alu and B2 RNAs |journal=IUBMB Life |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=831–7 |year=2009 |month=Aug |pmid=19621349  |doi=10.1002/iub.227 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Endogenous retrovirus]] sequences are the product of [[reverse transcription]] of [[retrovirus]] genomes into the genomes of [[germ cell]]s. Mutation within these retro-transcribed sequences can inactivate the viral genome.

Over 8% of the human genome is made up of (mostly decayed) endogenous retrovirus sequences, as part of the over 42% fraction that is recognizably derived of retrotransposons, while another 3% can be identified to be the remains of [[Transposon#Class II: DNA transposons|DNA transposon]]s. Much of the remaining half of the genome that is currently without an explained origin is expected to have found its origin in transposable elements that were active so long ago (&gt; 200 million years) that random mutations have rendered them unrecognizable.&lt;ref name=humangenome&gt;{{cite journal | author=International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium | month=February | year=2001 | title=Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome| journal=Nature | volume=409 | pages=879–888 | pmid= 11237011 | issue=6822 | doi=10.1038/35057062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genome size variation in at least two kinds of plants is mostly the result of retrotransposon sequences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/short/16/10/1252] [http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/short/16/10/1262?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telomeres===
[[Telomere]]s are regions of repetitive DNA at the end of a [[chromosome]], which provide protection from chromosomal deterioration during [[DNA replication]].

==Functions of noncoding DNA==
Many noncoding DNA sequences have important biological functions as indicated by [[comparative genomics]] studies that report some regions of noncoding DNA that are highly [[Conserved sequence|conserved]], sometimes on time-scales representing hundreds of millions of years, implying that these noncoding regions are under strong [[evolution]]ary pressure and [[Natural selection|positive selection]].&lt;ref name=Ludwig&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ludwig MZ |title=Functional evolution of noncoding DNA |journal=Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=634–9 |year=2002 |month=December |pmid=12433575 |doi= 10.1016/S0959-437X(02)00355-6|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959437X02003556}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the genomes of [[human]]s and [[mice]], which diverged from a [[common ancestor]] 65–75 million years ago, protein-coding DNA sequences account for only about 20% of conserved DNA, with the remaining 80% of conserved DNA is represented in noncoding regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cobb et al&quot;/&gt; [[Linkage mapping]] often identifies chromosomal regions associated with a disease with no evidence of functional coding variants of genes within the region, suggesting that disease-causing genetic variants lie in the noncoding DNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cobb et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cobb J, Büsst C, Petrou S, Harrap S, Ellis J |title=Searching for functional genetic variants in non-coding DNA |journal=Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=372–5 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18307723 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1681.2008.04880.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some specific sequences of noncoding DNA may be features essential to chromosome structure, [[centromere]] function and [[homology (biology)|homolog]] recognition in [[meiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Subirana JA, Messeguer X |title=The most frequent short sequences in non-coding DNA |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=1172–81 |year=2010 |month=March |pmid=19966278 |pmc=2831315 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkp1094 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a comparative study of over 300 prokaryotic and over 30 eukaryotic genomes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = S. E. Ahnert, [[Thomas Fink|T. M. A. Fink]] and A. Zinovyev | title=How much non-coding DNA do eukaryotes require? | url=http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~tmf20/PUBLICATIONS/jtb_07.pdf |format=PDF| journal=J Theor. Biol. | year=2008 | pages=587–592 | issue = 4 | pmid = 18384817 | volume=252 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[eukaryotes]] appear to require a minimum amount of non-coding DNA. This minimum amount can be predicted using a growth model for regulatory genetic networks, implying that it is required for regulatory purposes. In humans the predicted minimum is about 5% of the total genome.

=== Genetic switches ===
Some noncoding DNA sequences are genetic &quot;switches&quot; that regulate when and where genes are expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0508-60| author=Carroll, Sean B., et al.| month=May | year=2008 | title=Regulating Evolution | journal=Scientific American | pages=60–67 | volume=298 | issue=5| pmid=18444326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulation of gene expression ===
{{Main|Regulation of gene expression}}
Some noncoding DNA sequences determine the expression levels of various genes.&lt;ref name=Callaway&gt;{{cite journal | author=Callaway, Ewen | title=Junk DNA gets credit for making us who we are | journal=New Scientist |year=2010 | month=March | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18680-junk-dna-gets-credit-for-making-us-who-we-are.html?full=true&amp;print=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transcription factors ===
{{Main|Transcription factor}}
Some noncoding DNA sequences determine where transcription factors attach.&lt;ref name=Callaway/&gt;  A transcription factor is a protein that binds to specific non-coding DNA sequences, thereby controlling the flow (or transcription) of genetic information from DNA to mRNA.  Transcription factors act at very different locations on the genomes of different people.

=== Operators ===
{{Main|Operator (biology) }}
An operator is a segment of DNA to which a [[repressor]] binds. A repressor is a DNA-binding protein that regulates the expression of one or more genes by binding to the operator and blocking the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter, thus preventing transcription of the genes. This blocking of expression is called repression.

=== Enhancers ===
{{Main|Enhancer (genetics) }}
An enhancer is a short region of DNA that can be bound with proteins ([[trans-acting factors]]), much like a set of transcription factors, to enhance transcription levels of genes in a gene cluster.

=== Promoters ===
{{Main|Promoter (biology) }}
A promoter is a region of DNA that facilitates transcription of a particular gene. Promoters are typically located near the genes they regulate.

==Noncoding DNA and evolution==
Shared sequences of apparently non-functional DNA are a major line of [[evidence of common descent]].&lt;ref name=TO-FAQ&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/molgen/ &quot;Plagiarized Errors and Molecular Genetics&quot;], [[talkorigins]], by Edward E. Max, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudogene sequences appear to accumulate mutations more rapidly than coding sequences due to a loss of selective pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrov &amp; Hartl&quot;/&gt; This allows for the creation of mutant alleles that incorporate new functions that may be favored by natural selection; thus, pseudogenes can serve as raw material for [[evolution]] and can be considered &quot;protogenes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Balakirev ES, Ayala FJ |title=Pseudogenes: are they &quot;junk&quot; or functional DNA? |journal=Annu. Rev. Genet. |volume=37 |issue= |pages=123–51 |year=2003 |pmid=14616058 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.37.040103.103949 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Junk DNA==
Junk DNA is a term that was introduced in 1972 by [[Susumu Ohno]],&lt;ref name = Ohno&gt;{{cite book| author=S. Ohno | year=1972| last=[http://www.junkdna.com/ohno.html So much &quot;junk&quot; DNA in our genome]| first=In Evolution of Genetic Systems| editor=H. H. Smith| pages=366–370| publisher=Gordon and Breach, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; who noted that the [[mutational load]] from deleterious mutations placed an upper limit on the number of functional loci that could be expected given a typical mutation rate. Ohno predicted that mammal genomes could not have more than 30,000 loci under selection before the &quot;cost&quot; from the mutational load would cause an inescapable decline in fitness, and eventually extinction. This prediction remains robust, with the human genome containing approximately 20,000 genes. Junk DNA remains a label for the portions of a [[genome]] sequence for which no discernible [[Function (biology)|function]] had been identified. According to a 1980 review in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by [[Leslie Orgel]] and [[Francis Crick]], junk DNA has &quot;little specificity and conveys little or no selective advantage to the organism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Orgel LE, Crick FH |title=Selfish DNA: the ultimate parasite |journal=Nature |volume=284 |issue=5757 |pages=604–7 |year=1980 |month=April |pmid=7366731 |doi=10.1038/284604a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v284/n5757/abs/284604a0.html|bibcode = 1980Natur.284..604O }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used mainly in [[popular science]] and in a [[colloquialism|colloquial]] way in scientific publications, and its connotations may have slowed research into the biological functions of noncoding DNA.&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0307-104 |author=Khajavinia A, Makalowski W |title=What is &quot;junk&quot; DNA, and what is it worth? |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=296 |issue=5 |pages=104 |year=2007 |month=May |pmid=17503549 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-junk-dna-and-what |quote=The term &quot;junk DNA&quot; repelled mainstream researchers from studying noncoding genetic material for many years}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several lines of evidence indicate that some &quot;junk DNA&quot; sequences are likely to have unidentified functional activity, and other sequences may have had functions in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/443521a| title = Genetics: Junk DNA as an evolutionary force| pmid = 17024082| first2 = C | year = 2006| last2 = Vieira | author = Biémont, Christian | journal = Nature | volume = 443| issue = 7111 | pages = 521–4 | bibcode=2006Natur.443..521B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, a significant amount of the sequence of the genomes of eukaryotic organisms currently appears to fall under no existing classification other than &quot;junk&quot;. For example, one experiment removed 0.1% of the mouse genome with no detectable effect on the [[phenotype]].&lt;ref name=Nobrega&gt;{{cite journal | author=M.A. Nobrega, Y. Zhu, I. Plajzer-Frick, V. Afzal and E.M. Rubin | year=2004 | title=Megabase deletions of gene deserts result in viable mice| journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=431 | pages=988–993 | doi=10.1038/nature03022 | issue=7011 | pmid=15496924|bibcode = 2004Natur.431..988N }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result suggests that the removed DNA was largely nonfunctional. In addition, these sequences are enriched for the heterochromatic histone modification H3K9me3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenfeld_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  | last1 = Rosenfeld  | first1 = Jeffrey A | author1-link = Jeffrey A Rosenfeld | last2 = Wang | first2 = Zhibin | author2-link = Zhibin Wang | last3 = Schones | first3 = Dustin | author3-link = Dustin Schones | last4 = Zhao | first4=Keji | last5 = DeSalle | first5 = Rob | author4-link =  Rob DeSalle | last6= Zhang | first6 = Michael Q | author5-link = Michael Q.

==Noncoding DNA and Long range correlations==
A statistical distinction between coding and noncoding DNA sequences has been found.

      <comment>/* HKY85 model (Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano 1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hasegawa M, Kishino H, Yano T |year=1985 |title=Dating of human-ape splitting by a molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA |journal=Journal of  using [[Project:AWB|AWB]] (7863)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26370">A number of different [[Markov chain|Markov]] '''models of DNA sequence evolution''' have been proposed.  These [[substitution model]]s differ in terms of the parameters used to describe the rates at which one nucleotide replaces another during evolution. These models are frequently used in [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic analyses]]. In particular, they are used during the calculation of likelihood of a tree (in [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] and [[maximum likelihood]] approaches to tree estimation) and they are used to estimate the evolutionary distance between sequences from the observed differences between the sequences.

==Introduction==

These models are phenomenological descriptions of the evolution of DNA as a string of four discrete states. These Markov models do '''not''' explicitly depict the mechanism of mutation nor the action of natural selection. Rather they describe the relative rates of different changes.  For example, mutational biases and [[purifying selection]] favoring conservative changes are probably both responsible for the relatively high rate of [[Transition (genetics)|transitions]] compared to [[transversions]] in evolving sequences.  However, the Kimura (K80) model described below merely attempts to capture the effect of both forces in a parameter that reflects the relative rate of transitions to transversions.

Evolutionary analyses of sequences are conducted on a wide variety of time scales. Thus, it is convenient to express these models in terms of the instantaneous rates of change between different states (the ''Q'' matrices below).  If we are given a starting (ancestral) state at one position, the model's ''Q'' matrix and a branch length expressing the expected number of changes to have occurred since the ancestor, then we can derive the probability of the descendant sequence having each of the four states.  The mathematical details of this transformation from rate-matrix to probability matrix are described in [[Substitution model#The mathematics of substitution models|the mathematics of substitution models section]] of the [[substitution model]] page. By expressing models in terms of the instantaneous rates of change we can avoid estimating a large numbers of parameters for each branch on a phylogenetic tree (or each comparison if the analysis involves many pairwise sequence comparisons).

The models described on this page describe the evolution of a single site within a sequences. They are often used for analyzing the evolution of an entire [[locus (genetics)|locus]] by making the simplifying assumption that different sites evolve [[Iid|independently and are identically distributed]]. This assumption may be justifiable if the sites can be assumed to be evolving [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutrally]]. If the primary effect of natural selection on the evolution of the sequences is to constrain some sites, then models of among-site rate-heterogeneity can be used. This approaches allows one to estimate only one matrix of relative rates of substitution, and another set of parameters describing the variance in the total rate of substitution across sites.

==DNA evolution as a continuous-time Markov chain==
===Continuous-time Markov chains===
''Continuous-time'' [[Markov chains]] have the usual transition matrices 
which are, in addition, parameterized by time, &lt;math&gt; t\ &lt;/math&gt;.  Specifically, if &lt;math&gt; E_1,\ldots,E_4\ &lt;/math&gt; are the states, then the transition matrix 

: &lt;math&gt; P(t) = \big(P_{ij}(t)\big)&lt;/math&gt; where each individual entry, &lt;math&gt; P_{ij}(t)\ &lt;/math&gt; refers to the probability that state &lt;math&gt; E_i\ &lt;/math&gt; will change to state &lt;math&gt; E_j\ &lt;/math&gt; in time &lt;math&gt; t\ &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example:'''  We would like to model the substitution process in DNA sequences (''i.e.'' [[Jukes–Cantor]], Kimura, ''etc.'') in a continuous-time fashion.  The corresponding transition matrices will look like:

: &lt;math&gt;
P(t) = \begin{pmatrix}          p_{AA}(t) &amp; p_{GA}(t) &amp; p_{CA}(t) &amp; p_{TA}(t) \\

                                 p_{AC}(t) &amp; p_{GC}(t) &amp; p_{CC}(t) &amp; p_{TC}(t) \\
                                 p_{AT}(t) &amp; p_{GT}(t) &amp; p_{CT}(t) &amp; p_{TT}(t)
                                 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where the top-left and bottom-right 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2 blocks correspond to ''transition probabilities''  and the top-right and bottom-left 2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2 blocks corresponds to ''transversion probabilities''.

'''Assumption:'''  If at some time &lt;math&gt; t_0\ &lt;/math&gt;, the Markov chain is in state &lt;math&gt; E_i\ &lt;/math&gt;, then the probability that at time &lt;math&gt; t_0+t\ &lt;/math&gt;, it will be in state &lt;math&gt;E_j\ &lt;/math&gt; depends only upon &lt;math&gt;i\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t\ &lt;/math&gt;.  This then allows us to write that probability as &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}(t)\ &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' Continuous-time transition matrices satisfy:

::&lt;math&gt;P(t+\tau) = P(t)P(\tau)\ &lt;/math&gt;

===Deriving the dynamics of substitution===
Consider a DNA sequence of fixed length ''m'' evolving in time by base replacement.  Assume that the processes followed by the ''m'' sites are Markovian independent, identically distributed and constant in time.  For a fixed site, let

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P}(t) = (p_A(t),\  p_G(t),\  p_C(t),\  p_T(t))^T&lt;/math&gt;

be the column vector of probabilities of states &lt;math&gt;A, \ &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\ G, \ &lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\ C, \ &lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\ T \ &lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt; t \ &lt;/math&gt;.  Let 

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E} = \{A,\ G, \ C, \ T\}&lt;/math&gt;

be the state-space.  For two distinct 

:&lt;math&gt; x, y \in \mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt; \mu_{xy}\ &lt;/math&gt;

be the transition rate from state &lt;math&gt;x\ &lt;/math&gt; to state &lt;math&gt;y\ &lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, for any &lt;math&gt; x\ &lt;/math&gt;, let:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_x = \sum_{y\neq x}\mu_{xy}&lt;/math&gt;

The changes in the probability distribution &lt;math&gt; p_A(t)\ &lt;/math&gt; for small increments of time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t\ &lt;/math&gt;  are given by:
:&lt;math&gt;p_A(t+\Delta t) = p_A(t) - p_A(t)\mu_A\Delta t + \sum_{x\neq A}p_x(t)\mu_{xA}\Delta t &lt;/math&gt;

In other words (in frequentist language), the frequency of &lt;math&gt; A\ &lt;/math&gt;'s at time &lt;math&gt; t + \Delta t\ &lt;/math&gt; is equal to the frequency at time &lt;math&gt; t\ &lt;/math&gt; minus the frequency of the ''lost'' &lt;math&gt; A\ &lt;/math&gt;'s plus the frequency of the ''newly created'' &lt;math&gt; A\ &lt;/math&gt;'s.

Similarly for the probabilities &lt;math&gt;p_G(t), \ p_C(t), \ \mathrm{and} \ p_T(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  We can write these compactly as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(t+\Delta t) = \mathbf{P}(t) + Q\mathbf{P}(t)\Delta t &lt;/math&gt;

where,

:&lt;math&gt; Q = \begin{pmatrix} -\mu_A &amp; \mu_{GA} &amp; \mu_{CA} &amp; \mu_{TA} \\
                            \mu_{AG} &amp; -\mu_G  &amp; \mu_{CG} &amp; \mu_{TG} \\
                            \mu_{AC} &amp; \mu_{GC} &amp; -\mu_C  &amp; \mu_{TC} \\
                            \mu_{AT} &amp; \mu_{GT} &amp; \mu_{CT} &amp; -\mu_T \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
or, alternately:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P}'(t) = Q\mathbf{P}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;Q\ &lt;/math&gt; is the ''rate'' matrix.  Note that by definition, the columns of &lt;math&gt;Q\ &lt;/math&gt; sum to zero.

===Ergodicity===

If all the transition probabilities, &lt;math&gt; \mu_{xy}\ &lt;/math&gt; are positive, ''i.e.'' if all states &lt;math&gt; x, y \in \mathcal{E}\ &lt;/math&gt; ''communicate'', then the Markov chain has a ''stationary'' distribution &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\Pi} = \{\pi_x, \ x \in \mathcal{E} \} &lt;/math&gt; where each &lt;math&gt; \pi_x \ &lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of time spent in state &lt;math&gt; x\ &lt;/math&gt; after the Markov chain has run for infinite time, and this probability does not depend upon the initial state of the process.  Such a Markov chain is called, '''''ergodic'''''.  In DNA evolution, under the assumption of a common process for each site, the stationary frequencies, &lt;math&gt; \pi_A, \pi_G, \pi_C, \pi_T \ &lt;/math&gt; correspond to equilibrium base compositions.
 
'''Definition''' A Markov process is ''stationary'' if its current distribution is the stationary distribution, ''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P}(t) = \Pi\ &lt;/math&gt;  Thus, by using the differential equation above, 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\Pi}{dt} = Q\Pi = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

===Time reversibility===

'''Definition''': A stationary Markov process is ''time reversible'' if (in the steady state) the amount of change from state &lt;math&gt; x\ &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; y\ &lt;/math&gt; is equal to the amount of change from &lt;math&gt; y\ &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; x\ &lt;/math&gt;, (although the two states may occur with different frequencies).  This means that:
:&lt;math&gt; \pi_x\mu_{xy} = \pi_y\mu_{yx} \ &lt;/math&gt;

Not all stationary processes are reversible, however, almost all DNA evolution models assume time reversibility, which is considered to be a reasonable assumption.

Under the time reversibility assumption, let &lt;math&gt; s_{xy} = \mu_{xy}/\pi_y\ &lt;/math&gt;, then it is easy to see that:
:&lt;math&gt; s_{xy} = s_{yx} \ &lt;/math&gt;

'''Definition''' The symmetric term &lt;math&gt; s_{xy}\ &lt;/math&gt; is called the ''exchangeability'' between states &lt;math&gt;x\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y\ &lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, &lt;math&gt; s_{xy}\ &lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of the frequency of state &lt;math&gt; x\ &lt;/math&gt; that results as a result of transitions from state &lt;math&gt; y\ &lt;/math&gt; to state &lt;math&gt; x\ &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Corollary''' The 12 off-diagonal entries of the rate matrix, &lt;math&gt; Q\ &lt;/math&gt; (note the off-diagonal entries determine the diagonal entries, since the rows of &lt;math&gt; Q\ &lt;/math&gt; sum to zero) can be completely determined by 9 numbers; these are: 6  exchangeability terms and 3 stationary frequencies &lt;math&gt;\pi_x\ &lt;/math&gt;, (since the stationary frequencies sum to 1).

===Scaling of branch lengths===
By comparing extant sequences, one can determine the amount of sequence divergence. This raw measurement of divergence provides information about the number of changes that have occurred along the path separating the sequences. The simple count of differences (the [[Hamming distance]]) between sequences will often underestimate the number of substitution because of multiple hits (see [[homoplasy]]). Trying to estimate the exact number of changes that have occurred is difficult, and usually not necessary. Instead, branch lengths (and path lengths) in phylogenetic analyses are usually expressed in the expected number of changes per site. The path length is the product of the duration of the path in time and the mean rate of substitutions.  While their product can be estimated, the rate and time are not identifiable from sequence divergence. 

The descriptions of rate matrices on this page accurately reflect the relative magnitude of different substitutions, but these rate matrices are '''not''' scaled such that a branch length of 1 yields one expected change.  This scaling can be accomplished by multiplying every element of the matrix by the same factor, or simply by scaling the branch lengths. If we use the &amp;beta; to denote the scaling factor, and &amp;nu; to denote the branch length measured in the expected number of substitutions per site then &amp;beta;&amp;nu; is used the transition probability formulae below in place of &amp;mu;''t''. Note that &amp;nu; is a parameter to be estimated from data, and is referred to as the branch length, while &amp;beta; is simply a number that can be calculated from the rate matrix (it is not a separate free parameter).

The value of &amp;beta; can be found by forcing the expected rate of flux of states to 1. The diagonal entries of the rate-matrix (the ''Q'' matrix) represent -1 times the rate of leaving each state. For time-reversible models, we  know the equilibrium state frequencies (these are simply the &amp;pi;''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' parameter value for state ''i''). Thus we can find the expected rate of change by calculating the sum of flux out of each state weighted by the proportion of sites that are expected to be in that class. Setting &amp;beta; to be the reciprocal of this sum will guarantee that scaled process has an expected flux of 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = 1/\left(-\sum_i \pi_i\mu_{ii}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
For example, in the Jukes-Cantor, the scaling factor would be ''4/(3&amp;mu;)' because the rate of leaving each state is ''3&amp;mu;/4''.

== Most common models of DNA evolution ==
=== JC69 model ([[Thomas_Jukes|Jukes]] and [[Charles_Cantor|Cantor]], 1969)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jukes TH and Cantor CR |year=1969 |title=Evolution of Protein Molecules |pages=21–132 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
JC69 is the simplest [[substitution model]]. There are several assumptions. It assumes equal base frequencies &lt;math&gt;\left(\pi_A = \pi_G = \pi_C = \pi_T = {1\over4}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and equal [[mutation rates]]. The only parameter of this model is therefore &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, the overall substitution rate. As previously mentioned, this variable becomes a constant when we normalize to the mean-rate to 1.

: &lt;math&gt;Q = \begin{pmatrix} {*} &amp; {\mu\over 4} &amp; {\mu\over 4} &amp; {\mu\over 4} \\ {\mu\over 4} &amp; {*} &amp; {\mu\over 4}&amp; {\mu\over 4}\\ {\mu\over 4}&amp; {\mu\over 4}&amp; {*} &amp; {\mu\over 4}\\ {\mu\over 4}&amp; {\mu\over 4}&amp; {\mu\over 4}&amp; {*} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; P= \begin{pmatrix} {{1\over4} + {3\over4}e^{-t\mu}} &amp; {{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-t\mu}} &amp; {{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-t\mu}} &amp; {{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-t\mu}} \\\\ {{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-t\mu}} &amp; {{1\over4} + {3\over4}e^{-t\mu}} &amp; {{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-t\mu}} &amp; {{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-t\mu}} \\\\ {{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-t\mu}} &amp; {{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-t\mu}} &amp; {{1\over4} + {3\over4}e^{-t\mu}} &amp; {{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-t\mu}} \\\\ {{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-t\mu}} &amp; {{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-t\mu}} &amp; {{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-t\mu}} &amp; {{1\over4} + {3\over4}e^{-t\mu}}  \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

When branch length, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, is measured in the expected number of changes per site then:
: &lt;math&gt;P_{ij}(\nu) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
{1\over4} + {3\over4}e^{-4\nu/3}  &amp; \mbox{ if } i = j   \\
{1\over4} - {1\over4}e^{-4\nu/3}  &amp; \mbox{ if } i \neq j  
\end{array}
\right.&lt;/math&gt;

It is worth notice that &lt;math&gt;\nu={3\over4}t\mu=({\mu\over4}+{\mu\over4}+{\mu\over4})t&lt;/math&gt; what stands for sum of any column (or row) of matrix &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by time and thus means expected number of substitutions in time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (branch duration) for each particular site (per site) when the rate of substitution equals &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

Given the proportion &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; of sites that differ between the two sequences the Jukes-Cantor estimate of the evolutionary distance (in terms of the expected number of changes) between two sequences is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{d}=-{3\over4} \ln({1-{4\over3}p})=\hat{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
The &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; in this formula is frequently referred to as the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-distance. It is a [[sufficient statistic]] for calculated the Jukes-Cantor distance correction, but is not sufficient for the calculation of the evolutionary distance under the more complex models that follow (also note that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; used in subsequent formulae is not identical to the &quot;&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-distance&quot;).

=== K80 model ([[Motoo Kimura|Kimura]], 1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kimura M |year=1980 |title=A simple method for estimating evolutionary rates of base substitutions through comparative studies of nucleotide sequences |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=16 |pages=111–120 |doi=10.1007/BF01731581 |pmid=7463489}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

The K80 model distinguishes between [[Transition (genetics)|transitions]] (A &lt;-&gt; G, i.e. from purine to purine, or C &lt;-&gt; T, i.e. from pyrimidine to pyrimidine) and [[transversion]]s (from purine to pyrimidine or vice versa). In Kimura's original description of the model the &amp;alpha; and &amp;beta; were used denote the rates of these types of substitutions, but it is now more common to set the rate of transversions to 1 and use &amp;kappa; to denote the transition/transversion rate ratio (as is done below).  The K80 model assumes that all of the bases are equally frequent (''&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;=&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;=&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;=0.25'').

Rate matrix  &lt;math&gt;Q= \begin{pmatrix} {*} &amp; {\kappa} &amp; {1} &amp; {1} \\ {\kappa} &amp; {*} &amp; {1} &amp; {1} \\ {1} &amp; {1} &amp; {*} &amp; {\kappa} \\ {1} &amp; {1} &amp; {\kappa} &amp; {*}  \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The Kimura two-parameter distance is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{d} = - {1\over2}\ln(1-2p-q) - {1\over4} \ln (1-2q)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p'' is the proportion of sites that show transitional differences and 
''q'' is the proportion of sites that show transversional differences.

=== F81 model ([[Joe Felsenstein|Felsenstein]] 1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Felsenstein J |year=1981 |title=Evolutionary trees from DNA sequences: a maximum likelihood approach |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=17 |pages=368–376 |doi=10.1007/BF01734359 |pmid=7288891}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

[[Joseph Felsenstein|Felsenstein's]] 1981 model is an extension of the JC69 model in which base frequencies are allowed to vary from 0.25 (&lt;math&gt;\pi_T \ne \pi_C \ne \pi_A \ne \pi_G &lt;/math&gt;)

Rate matrix:

: &lt;math&gt;Q= \begin{pmatrix} {*} &amp; {\pi_C} &amp; {\pi_A} &amp; {\pi_G} \\ {\pi_T} &amp; {*} &amp; {\pi_A} &amp; {\pi_G} \\ {\pi_T} &amp; {\pi_C} &amp; {*} &amp; {\pi_G} \\ {\pi_T} &amp; {\pi_C} &amp; {\pi_A} &amp; {*}  \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

When branch length, &amp;nu;, is measured in the expected number of changes per site then:
: &lt;math&gt;\beta = 1/(1-\pi_A^2-\pi_C^2-\pi_G^2-\pi_T^2)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;P_{ij}(\nu) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
\pi_i + \left(1-\pi_i\right)e^{-\beta\nu}  &amp; \mbox{ if } i = j   \\
\pi_j\left(1- e^{-\beta\nu}\right) &amp; \mbox{ if } i \neq j

\right.&lt;/math&gt;

=== HKY85 model (Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano 1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hasegawa M, Kishino H, Yano T |year=1985 |title=Dating of human-ape splitting by a molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=22 |pages=160–174 |doi=10.1007/BF02101694 |pmid=3934395}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===

The HKY85 model can be thought of as combining the extensions made in the Kimura80 and Felsenstein81 models. Namely, it distinguishes between the rate of  [[Transition (genetics)|transitions]] and [[transversion]]s (using the &amp;kappa; parameter), and it allows unequal base frequencies (&lt;math&gt;\pi_T \ne \pi_C \ne \pi_A \ne \pi_G &lt;/math&gt;).  Felsenstein described an equivalent model in 1984 using a different parameterization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kishino H, Hasegawa M |year=1989 |title=Evaluation of the maximum likelihood estimate of the evolutionary tree topologies from DNA sequence data, and the branching order in hominoidea  |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=170–179 |doi=10.1007/BF02100115}}&lt;/ref&gt;; thus, the model is sometimes referred to as the F84 model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Felsenstein J, Churchill GA |year=1996 |title=A Hidden Markov Model approach to variation among sites in rate of evolution, and the branching order in hominoidea. |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=93–104 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/1/93}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

If we express the branch length, ''&amp;nu;'' in terms of the expected number of changes per site then:
:&lt;math&gt;\beta  = \frac{1}{2(\pi_A + \pi_G)(\pi_C + \pi_T) + 2\kappa[(\pi_A\pi_G) + (\pi_C\pi_T)]} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{AA}(\nu,\kappa,\pi)  =  \left[\pi_A\left(\pi_A + \pi_G + (\pi_C + \pi_T)e^{-\beta\nu}\right) + \pi_G e^{-(1 + (\pi_A + \pi_G)(\kappa - 1.0))\beta\nu}\right]/(\pi_A + \pi_G) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{AC}(\nu,\kappa,\pi)  =  \pi_C\left(1.0 - e^{-\beta\nu}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{AG}(\nu,\kappa,\pi)  =  \left[\pi_G\left(\pi_A + \pi_G + (\pi_C + \pi_T)e^{-\beta\nu}\right) - \pi_Ge^{-(1 + (\pi_A + \pi_G)(\kappa - 1.0))\beta\nu}\right] /\left(\pi_A + \pi_G\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_{AT}(\nu,\kappa,\pi)  =  \pi_T\left(1.0 - e^{-\beta\nu}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
and formula for the other combinations of states can be obtained by substituting in the appropriate base frequencies.

T92 is a simple mathematical method developed to estimate the number of nucleotide
substitutions per site between two DNA sequences, by extending Kimura’s (1980)
two-parameter method to the case where a G+C-content bias exists. This method
will be useful when there are strong transition-transversion and G+C-content biases,
as in the case of Drosophila mitochondrial DNA. (Tamura 1992)

One frequency only &lt;math&gt;\pi_{GC} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\pi_G = \pi_C = {\pi_{GC}\over 2}  &lt;/math&gt;

The evolutionary distance between two noncoding sequences according to this model is given by
:&lt;math&gt;d = -h \ln(1-{p\over h}-q)-{1\over2}(1-h)\ln(1-2q)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h = 2\theta(1-\theta)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\theta \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt; is the GC content.

The TN93 model distinguishes between the two different types of [[Transition (genetics)|transition]] - i.e. (A &lt;-&gt; G) is allowed to have a different rate to (C&lt;-&gt;T). [[Transversion]]s are all assumed to occur at the same rate, but that rate is allowed to be different from both of the rates for transitions.  

TN93 also allows unequal base frequencies (&lt;math&gt;\pi_T \ne \pi_C \ne \pi_A \ne \pi_G &lt;/math&gt;).

{x_2} &amp; {x_4} &amp; {-({\pi_1 x_2 \over \pi_3} + {\pi_2 x_4 \over \pi_3} + x_6)} &amp; {\pi_3 x_6 \over \pi_4} \\  
{x_3} &amp; {x_5} &amp; {x_6} &amp; {-({\pi_1 x_3 \over \pi_4} + {\pi_2 x_5 \over \pi_4} + {\pi_3 x_6 \over \pi_4})} 
\end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, GTR (for four characters, as is often the case in phylogenetics) requires 6 substitution rate parameters, as well as 4 equilibrium base frequency parameters. However, this is usually eliminated down to 9 parameters plus &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, the overall number of substitutions per unit time. When measuring time in substitutions (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;=1) only 9 free parameters remain.

In general, to compute the number of parameters, one must count the number of entries above the diagonal in the matrix, i.e. for n trait values per site &lt;math&gt;{{n^2-n} \over 2} &lt;/math&gt;, and then add ''n'' for the equilibrium base frequencies, and subtract 1 because &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is fixed. One gets

: &lt;math&gt;{{n^2-n} \over 2} + n - 1 = {1 \over 2}n^2 + {1 \over 2}n - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, for an amino acid sequence (there are 20 &quot;standard&quot; amino acids that make up [[proteins]]), one would find there are 209 parameters. However, when studying coding regions of the genome, it is more common to work with a [[codon]] substitution model (a codon is three bases and codes for one amino acid in a protein). There are &lt;math&gt;4^3 = 64&lt;/math&gt; codons, but the rates for transitions between codons which differ by more than one base is assumed to be zero. Hence, there are &lt;math&gt;{{20 \times 19 \times 3} \over 2} + 64 - 1 = 633&lt;/math&gt; parameters.

'''DNA methylation''' is a biochemical process that is important for normal development in higher organisms. It involves the addition of a [[methyl group]] to the [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Cyclic compounds|5 position]] of the [[cytosine]] pyrimidine ring or the number 6 nitrogen of the [[adenine]] purine ring (cytosine and adenine are two of the four bases of [[DNA]]). This modification can be inherited through [[cell division]]. 

DNA methylation is a crucial part of normal organismal development and cellular differentiation in higher organisms. DNA methylation stably alters the gene expression pattern in cells such that cells can &quot;remember where they have been&quot; or decrease gene expression; for example, cells programmed to be pancreatic islets during embryonic development remain pancreatic islets throughout the life of the organism without continuing signals telling them that they need to remain islets. DNA methylation is typically removed during [[zygote]] formation and re-established through successive cell divisions during development. However, the latest research shows that hydroxylation of methyl group occurs rather than complete removal of methyl groups in zygote.&lt;ref name=pmid21321204&gt;{{Cite pmid|21321204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some methylation modifications that regulate gene expression are inheritable and are referred to as [[epigenetic regulation]].

In addition, DNA methylation suppresses the expression of viral genes and other deleterious elements that have been incorporated into the genome of the host over time. DNA methylation also forms the basis of [[chromatin]] structure, which enables cells to form the myriad characteristics necessary for multicellular life from a single immutable sequence of DNA. DNA methylation also plays a crucial role in the development of nearly all types of cancer.&lt;ref name=pmid12610534&gt;{{Cite pmid|12610534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine has the specific effect of reducing gene expression and has been found in every [[vertebrate]] examined. In adult [[somatic]] tissues, DNA methylation typically occurs in a [[CpG site|CpG]] dinucleotide context; non-CpG methylation is prevalent in embryonic [[stem cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dodge JE, Ramsahoye BH, Wo ZG, Okano M, Li E |title=De novo methylation of MMLV provirus in embryonic stem cells: CpG versus non-CpG methylation |year=2002 |journal=[[Gene (journal)|Gene]] |volume=289 |issue=1–2 |pages=41–48 |doi=10.1016/S0378-1119(02)00469-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haines TR, Rodenhiser DI, Ainsworth PJ |title=Allele-Specific Non-CpG Methylation of the Nf1 Gene during Early Mouse Development |year=2001 |journal=[[Developmental Biology (journal)|Developmental Biology]] |volume=240 |issue=2 |pages=585–598 |doi=10.1006/dbio.2001.0504 |pmid=11784085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lister R, Pelizzola M, Dowen RH, ''et al.'' |title=Human DNA methylomes at base resolution show widespread epigenomic differences |journal=Nature |volume=462 |issue=7271 |pages=315–22 |year=2009 |month=October |pmid=19829295 |doi=10.1038/nature08514 |pmc=2857523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mammals==
DNA methylation is essential for normal development and is associated with a number of key processes including [[genomic imprinting]], [[X-chromosome inactivation]], suppression of repetitive elements, and [[carcinogenesis]].

Between 60% and 90% of all CpGs are methylated in mammals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrlich&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ehrlich M, Gama Sosa MA, Huang L-H., Midgett RM, Kuo KC, McCune RA, Gehrke C |title=Amount and distribution of 5-methylcytosine in human DNA from different types of tissues or cells |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=2709–2721 |year=1982 |month=April |pmid=7079182 |pmc=320645 |doi=10.1093/nar/10.8.2709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tucker KL |title=Methylated cytosine and the brain: a new base for neuroscience |journal=Neuron |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=649–652 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11430798 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00325-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methylated C residues spontaneously deaminate to form T residues over evolutionary time; hence CpG dinucleotides steadily mutate to TpG dinucleotides, which is evidenced by the under-representation of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome (they occur at only 21% of the expected frequency).&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Genome Sequencing and Analysis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, ''et al.'' |title=Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome |journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6822 |pages=860–921 |year=2001 |month=February |pmid=11237011 |doi=10.1038/35057062 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (On the other hand, spontaneous deamination of unmethylated C residues gives rise to U residues, a mutation that is quickly recognized and repaired by the cell.)

Unmethylated CpGs are often grouped in clusters called ''[[CpG islands]]'', which are present in the 5' [[regulatory regions]] of many [[genes]]. In many disease processes, such as [[cancer]], gene promoter [[CpG island]]s acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in [[transcriptional silencing]] that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing, but might be a target for [[epigenetic therapy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19707296&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Daura-Oller E, Cabre M, Montero MA, Paternain JL, Romeu A |title=Specific gene hypomethylation and cancer: New insights into coding region feature trends |journal=Bioinformation |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=340–343 |year=2009 |pmid=19707296 |pmc=2720671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA methylation may affect the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of [[transcription factor|transcriptional proteins]] to the gene, and second, and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). MBD proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as [[histone deacetylase]]s and other [[chromatin remodeling]] proteins that can modify [[histone]]s, thereby forming compact, inactive chromatin, termed [[heterochromatin]]. This link between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is very important. In particular, loss of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been implicated in [[Rett syndrome]]; and [[Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2|methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2)]] mediates the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes in cancer.

Research has suggested that long-term memory storage in humans may be regulated by DNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miller C, Sweatt J |title=Covalent modification of DNA regulates memory formation |journal=Neuron |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=857–869 |date=2007-03-15 |pmid=17359920 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2007.02.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memories may be stored on your DNA |last=Powell |first=Devin |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate=2008-12-02 |publisher=New Scientist |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.000-memories-may-be-stored-on-your-dna.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cancer===
DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and a large body of evidence has demonstrated that aberrant DNA methylation is associated with unscheduled gene silencing, and the genes with high levels of [[5-methylcytosine]] in their promoter region are transcriptionally silent. DNA methylation is essential during embryonic development, and in somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are generally transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been associated with a large number of human malignancies and found in two distinct forms: hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue. Hypermethylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications that repress transcription via promoter region of tumour suppressor genes. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms.&lt;ref name= CraigJMWongNC&gt;{{cite book | author= Craig, JM; Wong, NC (editor) | year=2011 | title=Epigenetics: A Reference Manual | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-88-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA methyltransferases==

In mammalian cells, DNA methylation occurs mainly at the C5 position of CpG dinucleotides and is carried out by two general classes of enzymatic activities – maintenance methylation and ''de novo'' methylation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Maintenance methylation activity is necessary to preserve DNA methylation after every cellular DNA replication cycle. Without the [[DNA methyltransferase]] (DNMT), the replication machinery itself would produce daughter strands that are unmethylated and, over time, would lead to passive demethylation. DNMT1 is the proposed maintenance methyltransferase that is responsible for copying DNA methylation patterns to the daughter strands during DNA replication. Mouse models with both copies of DNMT1 deleted are embryonic lethal at approximately day 9, due to the requirement of DNMT1 activity for development in mammalian cells.

It is thought that DNMT3a and DNMT3b are the ''de novo'' methyltransferases that set up DNA methylation patterns early in development. DNMT3L is a protein that is homologous to the other DNMT3s but has no catalytic activity. Instead, DNMT3L assists the ''de novo'' methyltransferases by increasing their ability to bind to DNA and stimulating their activity.  Finally, [[TRDMT1|DNMT2 (TRDMT1)]] has been identified as a DNA methyltransferase homolog, containing all 10 sequence motifs common to all DNA methyltransferases; however, DNMT2 (TRDMT1) does not methylate DNA but instead methylates cytosine-38 in the anticodon loop of aspartic acid transfer RNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16424344&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goll MG, Kirpekar F, Maggert KA, Yoder JA, Hsieh CL, Zhang X, Golic KG, Jacobsen SE, Bestor TH |title=Methylation of tRNAAsp by the DNA methyltransferase homolog Dnmt2 |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5759 |pages=395–398 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16424344 |doi=10.1126/science.1120976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since many tumor suppressor genes are silenced by DNA methylation during [[carcinogenesis]], there have been attempts to re-express these genes by inhibiting the DNMTs. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine ([[decitabine]]) is a [[base analog|nucleoside analog]] that inhibits DNMTs by trapping them in a covalent complex on DNA by preventing the β-elimination step of catalysis, thus resulting in the enzymes' degradation. However, for decitabine to be active, it must be incorporated into the [[genome]] of the cell, which can cause mutations in the daughter cells if the cell does not die. In addition, decitabine is toxic to the bone marrow, which limits the size of its therapeutic window. These pitfalls have led to the development of antisense RNA therapies that target the DNMTs by degrading their [[mRNA]]s and preventing their [[translation]]. However, it is currently unclear whether targeting DNMT1 alone is sufficient to reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by DNA methylation.

==In plants==
Significant progress has been made in understanding DNA methylation in the model plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. DNA methylation in plants differs from that of mammals: while DNA methylation in mammals mainly occurs on the cytosine nucleotide in a [[CpG site]], in plants the cytosine can be methylated at CpG, CpHpG, and CpHpH sites, where H represents any nucleotide but guanine.

The principal ''Arabidopsis'' DNA methyltransferase enzymes, which transfer and covalently attach methyl groups onto DNA, are DRM2, MET1, and CMT3. Both the DRM2 and MET1 proteins share significant homology to the mammalian methyltransferases DNMT3 and DNMT1, respectively, whereas the CMT3 protein is unique to the plant kingdom. There are currently two classes of DNA methyltransferases: 1) the ''de novo'' class, or enzymes that create new methylation marks on the DNA; and 2) a maintenance class that recognizes the methylation marks on the parental strand of DNA and transfers new methylation to the daughters strands after DNA replication. DRM2 is the only enzyme that has been implicated as a ''de novo'' DNA methyltransferase. DRM2 has also been shown, along with MET1 and CMT3 to be involved in maintaining methylation marks through DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cao X and Jacobsen SE |title=Locus-specific control of asymmetric and CpNpG methylation by the DRM and CMT3 methyltransferase genes |year=2002 |month=December |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=99 |issue=Suppl 4 |pages=16491–16498 |doi=10.1073/pnas.162371599 |pmid=12151602 |pmc=139913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other DNA methyltransferases are expressed in plants but have no known function (see the [http://chromdb.org Chromatin Database]).

It is not clear how the cell determines the locations of ''de novo'' DNA methylation, but evidence suggests that, for many (though not all) locations, [[RNA-directed DNA methylation]] (RdDM) is involved. In RdDM, specific RNA transcripts are produced from a genomic DNA template, and this RNA forms secondary structures called double-stranded RNA molecules.&lt;ref name=&quot;aufsatz&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aufsatz W, Mette MF, van der Winden J, Matzke AJM, Matzke M |title=RNA-directed DNA methylation in Arabidopsis |year=2002 |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=99 |issue=90004 |pages=16499–16506 |doi=10.1073/pnas.162371499 |pmid=12169664 |pmc=139914}}&lt;/ref&gt; The double-stranded RNAs, through either the small interfering RNA ([[siRNA]]) or microRNA ([[miRNA]]) pathways direct de-novo DNA methylation of the original genomic location that produced the RNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;aufsatz&quot;/&gt; This sort of mechanism is thought to be important in cellular defense against [[RNA viruses]] and/or [[transposons]], both of which often form a double-stranded RNA that can be mutagenic to the host genome. By methylating their genomic locations, through an as yet poorly-understood mechanism, they are shut off and are no longer active in the cell, protecting the genome from their mutagenic effect.

==In fungi==

It can be seen that many [[fungi]] have low levels (0.1 to 0.5%) of cytosine methylation, whereas other fungi have as much as 5% of the genome methylated.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6330093&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Antequera F, Tamame M, Villanueva JR, Santos T |title=DNA methylation in the fungi |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=259 |issue=13 |pages=8033–8036 |year=1984 |month=July |pmid=6330093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This value seems to vary both among species and among isolates of the same species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Binz T, D'Mello N, Horgen PA |title=A comparison of DNA methylation levels in selected isolates of higher fungi |year=1998 |journal=[[Mycologia (journal)|Mycologia]] |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=785–790 |doi=10.2307/3761319 |jstor=3761319 |publisher=Mycological Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that DNA methylation may be involved in state-specific control of [[gene expression]] in fungi.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Although brewers' yeast (''[[Saccharomyces]]'') and fission yeast (''[[Schizosaccharomyces]]'') have very little DNA methylation, the model filamentous fungus ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'' has a well-characterized methylation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Selker EU, Tountas NA, Cross SH, Margolin BS, Murphy JG, Bird AP, Freitag M |title=The methylated component of the Neurospora crassa genome |year=2003 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=422 |issue=6934 |pages=893–897 |doi=10.1038/nature01564 |pmid=12712205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several genes control methylation in ''Neurospora'' and mutation of the DNA methyl transferase, ''dim-2'', eliminates all DNA methylation but does not affect growth or sexual reproduction.
While the ''Neurospora'' genome has very little repeated DNA, half of the methylation occurs in repeated DNA including [[transposon]] relics and centromeric DNA. The ability to evaluate other important phenomena in a DNA methylase-deficient genetic background makes ''Neurospora'' an important system in which to study DNA methylation.

==In bacteria==

[[Adenine]] or [[cytosine]] methylation is part of the [[restriction modification system]] of many [[bacterium|bacteria]], in which specific DNA sequences are methylated periodically throughout the genome. A [[methylase]] is the enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence and methylates one of the bases in or near that sequence. Foreign DNAs (which are not methylated in this manner) that are introduced into the cell are degraded by sequence-specific [[restriction enzyme]]s and cleaved. Bacterial genomic DNA is not recognized by these restriction enzymes. The methylation of native DNA acts as a sort of primitive immune system, allowing the bacteria to protect themselves from infection by [[bacteriophage]].

''[[E. coli]]'' [[Dna adenine methylase|DNA adenine methyltransferase]] (Dam) is an enzyme of ~32 kDa that does not belong to a restriction/modification system. The target recognition sequence for ''E. coli'' Dam is GATC, as the methylation occurs at the N6 position of the adenine in this sequence (G meATC). The three base pairs flanking each side of this site also influence DNA–Dam binding. Dam plays several key roles in bacterial processes, including mismatch repair, the timing of DNA replication, and gene expression. As a result of DNA replication, the status of GATC sites in the ''E. coli'' genome changes from fully methylated to hemimethylated. This is because adenine introduced into the new DNA strand is unmethylated. Re-methylation occurs within two to four seconds, during which time replication errors in the new strand are repaired. Methylation, or its absence, is the marker that allows the repair apparatus of the cell to differentiate between the template and nascent strands. It has been shown that altering Dam activity in bacteria results in increased spontaneous mutation rate. Bacterial viability is compromised in dam mutants that also lack certain other DNA repair enzymes, providing further evidence for the role of Dam in DNA repair.

One region of the DNA that keeps its hemimethylated status for longer is the [[origin of replication]], which has an abundance of GATC sites. This is central to the bacterial mechanism for timing DNA replication. SeqA binds to the origin of replication, sequestering it and thus preventing methylation. Because hemimethylated origins of replication are inactive, this mechanism limits DNA replication to once per cell cycle.

Expression of certain genes, for example those coding for [[pilus]] expression in ''E. coli'', is regulated by the methylation of GATC sites in the promoter region of the gene operon. The cells' environmental conditions just after DNA replication determine whether Dam is blocked from methylating a region proximal to or distal from the promoter region. Once the pattern of methylation has been created, the pilus gene transcription is locked in the on or off position until the DNA is again replicated. In ''E. coli'', these pilus [[operon]]s have important roles in virulence in urinary tract infections. It has been proposed{{By whom|date=December 2010}} that inhibitors of Dam may function as antibiotics.

On the other hand, DNA cytosine methylase targets CCAGG and CCTGG sites to methylate cytosine at the C5 position (C meC(A/T)GG). The other methylase enzyme, EcoKI, causes mehtylation of adenine in the sequences AAC(N6A)GTGC and GCAC(N6A)GTT.

Most strains used by molecular biologists are derivatives of K-12, and possess both Dam and Dcm, but there are commercially available strains that possess dam-/dcm- activity. In fact, it is possible to unmethylate the DNA extracted from dam+/dcm+ strains by transforming into dam-/dcm- strains. This would help digest sequences that are not being recognized by methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Palmer BR and Marinus MG |title=The dam and dcm strains of Escherichia coli—a review |journal=Gene |volume=143 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |year=1994 |doi=10.1016/0378-1119(94)90597-5 |pmid=8200522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Making unmethylated (dam-/dcm-) DNA |url=http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/tech_reference/restriction_enzymes/making_unmethylated_dna.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
DNA methylation can be detected by the following assays currently used in scientific research:
*[[Bisulfite_sequencing#Methylation-specific_PCR_.28MSP.29|Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP)]], which is based on a chemical reaction of sodium bisulfite with DNA that converts unmethylated cytosines of CpG dinucleotides to uracil or UpG, followed by traditional [[PCR]]. However, methylated cytosines will not be converted in this process, and primers are designed to overlap the CpG site of interest, which allows one to determine methylation status as methylated or unmethylated.
*[[Bisulfite_sequencing#Applications:_genome-wide_methylation_analysis|Whole genome bisulfite sequencing]], also known as BS-Seq, which is a high-throughput genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation. It is based on aforementioned sodium bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA, which is then sequencing on a [[Next-generation_sequencing#High-throughput_sequencing|Next-generation sequencing platform]]. The sequences obtained are then re-aligned to the reference genome to determine methylation states of CpG dinucleotides based on mismatches resulting from the conversion of unmethylated cytosines into uracil.
*The [[HELP assay]], which is based on restriction enzymes' differential ability to recognize and cleave methylated and unmethylated CpG DNA sites.
*[[ChIP-on-chip]] assays, which is based on the ability of commercially prepared antibodies to bind to DNA methylation-associated proteins like MeCP2.
*[[Restriction landmark genomic scanning]], a complicated and now rarely-used assay based upon restriction enzymes' differential recognition of methylated and unmethylated CpG sites; the assay is similar in concept to the HELP assay.
*[[Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation]] (MeDIP), analogous to [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]], [[immunoprecipitation]] is used to isolate methylated DNA fragments for input into DNA detection methods such as [[DNA microarrays]] (MeDIP-chip) or [[DNA sequencing]] (MeDIP-seq).
*[[Pyrosequencing]] of bisulfite treated DNA. This is sequencing of an amplicon made by a normal forward primer but a biatenylated reverse primer to PCR the gene of choice. The Pyrosequencer then analyses the sample by denaturing the DNA and adding one nucleotide at a time to the mix according to a sequence given by the user. If there is a mis-match, it is recorded and the percentage of DNA for which the mis-match is present is noted. This gives the user a percentage methylation per CpG island.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34647">'''DNA barcoding''' is a [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] method that uses a short genetic marker in an organism's DNA to identify it as belonging to a particular [[species]]. It differs from [[molecular phylogeny]] in that the main goal is not to determine classification but to identify an unknown sample in terms of a known classification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kress&quot;/&gt; Although barcodes are sometimes used in an effort to identify unknown species or assess whether species should be combined or separated,&lt;ref&gt;Koch, H. 2010. Combining morphology and DNA barcoding resolves the taxonomy of Western Malagasy ''Liotrigona'' Moure, 1961. ''[[African Invertebrates]]'' '''51''' (2): 413-421.[http://www.africaninvertebrates.org.za/Koch_2010_51_2_474.aspx][http://www.tb1.ethz.ch/PublicationsEO/PDFpapers/Koch_AFRICAN_INVERTEBRATES_2010_51_413-421.pdf PDF fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt; the utility of DNA barcoding for these purposes is subject to debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;seberg2009&quot; &gt;{{Cite journal | journal = PLoS ONE | year = 2009 | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = e4598 | title = How Many Loci Does it Take to DNA Barcode a Crocus? | author = Seberg O, Petersen G. | pmid = 19240801 | pmc = 2643479 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004598 | editor1-last = Stout | editor1-first = Jane Catherine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications include, for example, identifying plant leaves even when flowers or fruit are not available, identifying insect larvae (which typically have fewer diagnostic characters than adults), identifying the diet of an animal based on stomach contents or faeces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Analysing diet of small herbivores: the efficiency of DNA barcoding coupled with high-throughput pyrosequencing for deciphering the composition of complex plant mixtures | author = Eeva M Soininen | journal = Frontiers in Zoology | year = 2009 | volume = 6 | pages = 16 | doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-6-16 | pmid = 19695081 | pmc = 2736939 | author-separator = , | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Valentini | first2 = Alice | last3 = Coissac | first3 = Eric | last4 = Miquel | first4 = Christian | last5 = Gielly | first5 = Ludovic | last6 = Brochmann | first6 = Christian | last7 = Brysting | first7 = Anne K | last8 = Sønstebø | first8 = Jørn H | last9 = Ims | first9 = Rolf A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and identifying products in commerce (for example, herbal supplements or wood).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kress&quot;/&gt;

==Choice of Locus==

A desirable locus for DNA barcoding should be standardized (so that large databases of sequences for that locus can be developed),&lt;ref name=&quot;janzen2009&quot;/&gt; present in most of the taxa of interest and sequencable without species-specific [[PCR primer]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;janzen2009&quot;/&gt; short enough to be easily sequenced with current technology,&lt;ref name=&quot;kress2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Kress WJ, Erickson DL | year = 2008 | journal = PNAS | title = DNA barcodes: Genes, genomics, and bioinformatics | volume = 105 | issue = 8 | pages = 2761–2762 | pmc = 2268532 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0800476105 | pmid = 18287050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and provide a large variation between species yet a relatively small amount of variation within a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | date = 2008-02-26 | volume = 105 | issue = 8 | pages = 2923–2928 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0709936105 | pmc = 2268561 | title = DNA barcoding the floras of biodiversity hotspots | author = Renaud Lahaye | pmid = 18258745 | author-separator = , | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Van Der Bank | first2 = M. | last3 = Bogarin | first3 = D. | last4 = Warner | first4 = J. | last5 = Pupulin | first5 = F. | last6 = Gigot | first6 = G. | last7 = Maurin | first7 = O. | last8 = Duthoit | first8 = S. | last9 = Barraclough | first9 = T. G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several loci have been suggested, a common set of choices are:

* For animals and many other eukaryotes, the mitochondrial CO1 gene

* For [[land plants]], the concatenation of the [[rbcL]] and [[matK]] chloroplast genes&lt;ref name=&quot;janzen2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title = A DNA barcode for land plants | author = CBOL Plant Working Group | journal = PNAS | date = August 4, 2009 | volume = 106 | issue = 31 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0905845106 | pmc = 2722355 | pages = 12794–12797 | pmid = 19666622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitochondrial DNA===
DNA barcoding is based on a relatively simple concept. Most [[eukaryote]] cells contain [[mitochondria]], and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a relatively fast [[mutation]] rate, which results in significant variation in mtDNA sequences between species and, in principle, a comparatively small variance within species. A 658-[[base pair|bp]] region of the [[mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome c oxidase]] subunit I (COI) gene was proposed as a potential 'barcode'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hebert PDN, Cywinska A, Ball SL, and deWaard JR |title=Biological identifications through DNA barcodes |journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B |volume=270 |issue=1512 |pages=313–321 |date=7 February 2003|doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2218 |pmc=1691236 |pmid=12614582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, because all [[mtDNA]] genes are maternally inherited (direct evidence for recombination in mtDNA is available in some [[bivalve]]s such as ''Mytilus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ladoukakis ED, Zouros E |title=Direct evidence for homologous recombination in mussel (''Mytilus galloprovincialis'') mitochondrial DNA |journal=Mol.

===Identifying flowering plants===

Kress ''et al.'' (2005&lt;ref name=&quot;Kress&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kress WJ, Wurdack KJ, Zimmer EA, Weigt LA, Janzen DH |title=Use of DNA barcodes to identify flowering plants |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=102 |issue=23 |pages=8369–74 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15928076 |pmc=1142120 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0503123102 }} [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0503123102/DC1 Supporting Information]&lt;/ref&gt;) suggest that the use of the COI sequence “is not appropriate for most species of plants because of a much slower rate of cytochrome c oxidase I gene evolution in higher plants than in animals”. A series of experiments was then conducted to find a more suitable region of the [[genome]] for use in the DNA barcoding of [[flowering plant]]s (or the larger group of [[land plant]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;kress2008&quot; /&gt; One 2005 proposal was the nuclear [[internal transcribed spacer]] region and the plastid trnH-psbA intergenic spacer;&lt;ref name=Kress/&gt; other researchers advocated other regions such as [[matK]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kress2008&quot; /&gt;

In 2009, a collaboration of a large group of plant DNA barcode researchers proposed two chloroplast genes, [[rbcL]] and [[matK]], taken together, as a barcode for plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;janzen2009&quot;/&gt; Jesse Ausubel, a DNA barcode researcher not involved in that effort, suggested that standardizing on a sequence was the best way to produce a large database of plant sequences, and that time would tell whether this choice would be sufficiently good at distinguishing different plant species.&lt;ref name=&quot;ausubel&quot;/&gt;

==Vouchered specimens==
DNA sequence databases like GenBank contain many sequences that are not tied to vouchered specimens (for example, herbarium specimens, cultured cell lines, or sometimes images). This is problematic in the face of taxonomic issues such as whether several species should be split or combined, or whether past identifications were sound. Therefore, best practice for DNA barcoding is to sequence vouchered specimens.&lt;ref name=&quot;schander2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;miller2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. | date = 2007-03-20 | volume = 104 | issue = 12 | pages = 4775–4776 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0700466104 | pmc = 1829212 | title = DNA barcoding and the renaissance of taxonomy | author = Scott E. Miller | pmid = 17363473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

The use of [[nucleotide]] sequence variations to investigate evolutionary relationships is not a new concept. [[Carl Woese]] used sequence differences in [[rRNA|ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) to discover [[archaea]], which in turn led to the redrawing of the [[evolutionary tree]], and molecular markers (e.g., allozymes, rDNA, and mtDNAvage ) have been successfully used in molecular [[systematics]] for decades. DNA barcoding provides a standardised method for this process via the use of a short DNA sequence from a particular region of the genome to provide a 'barcode' for identifying species. In 2003, [[Paul D.N. Hebert]] from the [[University of Guelph]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], proposed the compilation of a public library of DNA barcodes that would be linked to named [[specimen]]s. This library would “provide a new master key for identifying species, one whose power will rise with increased taxon coverage and with faster, cheaper sequencing”.

==Case studies==
===Identification of birds===

In an effort to find a correspondence between traditional species boundaries established by taxonomy and those inferred by DNA barcoding, Hebert and co-workers sequenced DNA barcodes of 260 of the 667 bird species that breed in [[North America]] (Hebert ''et al.'' 2004a&lt;ref name=HebertBirds&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hebert PD, Stoeckle MY, Zemlak TS, Francis CM |title=Identification of Birds through DNA Barcodes |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e312 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15455034 |pmc=518999 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020312 }} [http://biology.plosjournals.org/archive/1545-7885/2/10/supinfo/10.1371_journal.pbio.0020312.sg001.pdf Supporting Information]&lt;/ref&gt;). They found that every single one of the 260 species had a different COI sequence. 130 species were represented by two or more specimens; in all of these species, COI sequences were either identical or were most similar to sequences of the same species. COI variations between species averaged 7.93%, whereas variation within species averaged 0.43%. In four cases there were deep intraspecific divergences, indicating possible new species. Three out of these four [[polytypic]] species are already split into two by some taxonomists. Hebert ''et al.'''s (2004a&lt;ref name=HebertBirds/&gt;) results reinforce these views and strengthen the case for DNA barcoding. Hebert ''et al.'' also proposed a standard sequence threshold to define new species, this threshold, the so-called &quot;barcoding gap&quot;, was defined as 10 times the mean intraspecific variation for the group under study.

===Delimiting cryptic species===

The next major study into the efficacy of DNA barcoding was focused on the [[neotropical]] skipper butterfly, ''[[Astraptes|Astraptes fulgerator]]'' at the [[Area Conservacion de Guanacaste]] (ACG) in north-western [[Costa Rica]]. This species was already known as a [[cryptic species complex]], due to subtle [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] differences, as well as an unusually large variety of [[caterpillar]] food plants. However, several years would have been required for taxonomists to completely delimit species. Hebert ''et al.'' (2004b&lt;ref name=HebertAstraptes&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hebert PD, Penton EH, Burns JM, Janzen DH, Hallwachs W |title=Ten species in one: DNA barcoding reveals cryptic species in the neotropical skipper butterfly Astraptes fulgerator |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=101 |issue=41 |pages=14812–7 |year=2004 |month=October |pmid=15465915 |pmc=522015 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0406166101 }} [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0406166101/DC1 Supporting Information]&lt;/ref&gt;) sequenced the COI gene of 484 specimens from the ACG. This sample included “at least 20 individuals reared from each species of food plant, extremes and intermediates of adult and caterpillar color variation, and representatives” from  the three major ecosystems where ''Astraptes fulgerator'' is found. Hebert ''et al.'' (2004b&lt;ref name=HebertAstraptes/&gt;) concluded that ''Astraptes fulgerator'' consists of 10 different species in north-western Costa Rica. These results, however, were subsequently challenged by Brower (2006&lt;ref name=Brower&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brower AVZ |title=Problems with DNA barcodes for species delimitation: 'ten species' of ''Astraptes fulgerator'' reassessed (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) |journal=Systematics and Biodiversity |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=127–32 |year=2006 |doi=10.1017/S147720000500191X }}&lt;/ref&gt;), who pointed out numerous serious flaws in the analysis, and concluded that the original data could support no more than the possibility of three to seven cryptic [[taxa]] rather than ten cryptic species. This highlights that the results of DNA barcoding analyses can be dependent upon the choice of analytical methods used by the investigators, so the process of delimiting cryptic species using DNA barcodes can be as subjective as any other form of taxonomy.

A more recent example used DNA barcoding for the identification of cryptic species included in the ongoing long-term database of tropical caterpillar life generated by Dan Janzen and Winnie Hallwachs in Costa Rica at the ACG.&lt;ref name=caterpillar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://janzen.sas.upenn.edu/caterpillars/database.lasso |title=Database homepage for ACG caterpillar (Lepidoptera) rearing databases |accessdate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 Smith ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Smith2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith MA, Woodley NE, Janzen DH, Hallwachs W, Hebert PD |title=DNA barcodes reveal cryptic host-specificity within the presumed polyphagous members of a genus of parasitoid flies (Diptera: Tachinidae) |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=103 |issue=10 |pages=3657–62 |year=2006 |pmc=1383497 |pmid=16505365 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0511318103}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined whether a COI DNA barcode could function as a tool for identification and discovery for the 20 morphospecies of ''[[Belvosia]]'' [http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=650659] [[parasitoid]] flies ([[Tachinidae]]) that have been reared from [[caterpillar]]s in ACG. Barcoding not only discriminated among all 17 highly host-specific morphospecies of ACG ''Belvosia'', but it also suggested that the species count could be as high as 32 by indicating that each of the three generalist species might actually be arrays of highly host-specific cryptic species.

In 2007 Smith ''et al.'' expanded on these results by barcoding 2,134 flies belonging to what appeared to be the 16 most generalist of the ACG tachinid morphospecies.&lt;ref name=Smith2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith MA, Wood DM, Janzen DH, Hallwachs W, Hebert PD |title=DNA barcodes affirm that 16 species of apparently generalist tropical parasitoid flies (Diptera, Tachinidae) are not all generalists |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=104 |issue=12 |pages=4967–72 |year=2007 |pmc=1821123 |pmid=17360352 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0700050104}}&lt;/ref&gt; They encountered 73 mitochondrial lineages separated by an average of 4% sequence divergence and, as these lineages are supported by collateral ecological information, and, where tested, by independent nuclear markers (28S and ITS1), the authors therefore viewed these lineages as provisional species. Each of the 16 initially apparent generalist species were categorized into one of four patterns: (i) a single generalist species, (ii) a pair of morphologically cryptic generalist species, (iii) a complex of specialist species plus a generalist, or (iv) a complex of specialists with no remaining generalist. In sum, there remained 9 generalist species classified among the 73 mitochondrial lineages analyzed.

However, also in 2007, Whitworth ''et al.'' reported that flies in the related family [[Calliphoridae]] could not be discriminated by barcoding.&lt;ref name=Whitworthetal/&gt; They investigated the performance of barcoding in the fly genus ''[[Protocalliphora]]'', known to be infected with the [[endosymbiotic]] bacteria ''[[Wolbachia]]''. Assignment of unknown individuals to species was impossible for 60% of the species, and if the technique had been applied, as in the previous study, to identify new species, it would have underestimated the species number in the genus by 75%. They attributed the failure of barcoding to the non-monophyly of many of the species at the mitochondrial level; in one case, individuals from four different species had identical barcodes. The authors went on to state: {{quote|The pattern of ''Wolbachia'' infection strongly suggests that the lack of within-species monophyly results from introgressive hybridization associated with ''Wolbachia'' infection.

Marine biologists have also considered the value of the technique in identifying cryptic and polymorphic species and have suggested that the technique may be helpful when associations with voucher specimens are maintained,&lt;ref name=&quot;schander2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schander C, Willassen E |title=What can Biological Barcoding do for Marine Biology? |journal=Marine Biology Research |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=79–83 |year=2005 |doi=10.1080/17451000510018962 |url=http://www.bolinfonet.org/pdf/schander&amp;willassen_2005.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; though cases of &quot;shared barcodes&quot; (e.g., non-unique) have been documented in [[cichlid]] fishes and [[cowries]]&lt;ref name =Meier/&gt;

===Cataloguing ancient life===

Lambert ''et al.'' (2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lambert DM, Baker A, Huynen L, Haddrath O, Hebert PD, Millar CD |title=Is a large-scale DNA-based inventory of ancient life possible? |journal=J. Hered. |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=279–84 |year=2005 |pmid=15731217 |doi=10.1093/jhered/esi035 |url=http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/96/3/279.pdf  |format=PDF fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;) examined the possibility of using DNA barcoding to assess the past diversity of the Earth's [[biota (ecology)|biota]]. The COI gene of a group of extinct [[ratite]] birds, the [[moa]], were sequenced using 26 [[subfossil]] moa bones. As with Hebert's results, each species sequenced had a unique barcode and intraspecific COI sequence variance ranged from 0 to 1.24%. To determine new species, a standard sequence threshold of 2.7% COI sequence difference was set. This value is 10 times the average intraspecies difference of North American birds, which is inconsistent with Hebert's recommendation that the threshold value be based on the group under study. Using this value, the group detected six moa species. In addition, a further standard sequence threshold of 1.24% was also used. This value resulted in 10 moa species which corresponded with the previously known species with one exception. This exception suggested a possible complex of species which was previously unidentified. Given the slow rate of growth and reproduction of moa, it is probable that the interspecies variation is rather low. On the other hand, there is no set value of molecular difference at which populations can be assumed to have irrevocably started to undergo [[speciation]]. It is safe to say, however, that the 2.7% COI sequence difference initially used was far too high.

===The Moorea Biocode Project===

The [http://www.mooreabiocode.org/ Moorea Biocode Project] is a barcoding initiative to create the first comprehensive inventory of all non-microbial life in a complex tropical ecosystem, the island of Moorea in Tahiti. Supported by a grant from the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]], the Moorea Biocode Project is a 3-year project that brings together researchers from the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[UC Berkeley]], France’s [[CNRS|National Center for Scientific Research]] (CNRS), and other partners. The outcome of the project is a library of genetic markers and physical identifiers for every species of plant, animal and fungi on the island that will be provided as a publicly available database resource for ecologists and evolutionary biologists around the world.

The software back-end to the Moore Biocode Project is [[Geneious|Geneious Pro]] and two custom-developed plugins from the [[New Zealand]]-based company, [[Biomatters]]. The [http://software.mooreabiocode.org/index.php?title=Main_Page|Geneious Biocode LIMS and Genbank Submission] plugins have been made freely available to the public&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-itworld.com/2010/11/30/biomatters-moorea-LIMS.html LIMS Made Freely Available to DNA Barcoding Community - Bio-IT World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and users of the free Geneious Basic software will be able to access and view the Biocode database upon completion of the project, while a commercial copy of Geneious Pro is required for researchers involved int data creation and analysis.

==Criticisms==
DNA barcoding has met with spirited reaction from scientists, especially [[systematics|systematists]], ranging from enthusiastic endorsement to vociferous opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rubinoff D, Cameron S, Will K |title=A genomic perspective on the shortcomings of mitochondrial DNA for &quot;barcoding&quot; identification |journal=J. Hered. |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=581–94 |year=2006 |pmid=17135463 |doi=10.1093/jhered/esl036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many stress the fact that DNA barcoding does not provide reliable information above the species level, while others indicate that it is inapplicable at the species level, but may still have merit for higher-level groups.&lt;ref name = Whitworthetal/&gt; Others resent what they see as a gross oversimplification of the science of taxonomy. And, more practically, some suggest that recently diverged species might not be distinguishable on the basis of their COI sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin, C.R. Kerr, Mark Y. Stoeckle, Carla J. Dove, Lee A. Weigt, Charles M. Francis &amp; Paul D. N. Hebert. 2006. Comprehensive DNA barcode coverage of North American birds. Molecular Ecology Notes.

Studies with insects suggest an equal or even greater error rate, due to the frequent lack of correlation between the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome or the lack of a barcoding gap (e.g., Hurst and Jiggins, 2005,&lt;ref name=Hurstetal/&gt; Whitworth ''et al.'', 2007,&lt;ref name=Whitworthetal/&gt; Wiemers &amp; Fiedler, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wiemers M, Fiedler K |title=Does the DNA barcoding gap exist? – a case study in blue butterflies (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) |journal=Front.

Problems with mtDNA arising from male-killing microoroganisms and cytoplasmic incompatibility-inducing symbionts (e.g., ''[[Wolbachia]]'')&lt;ref name=JohnstoneHurst/&gt; are also particularly common among insects. Given that insects represent over 75% of all known organisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Moritz and Cicero (2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moritz C, Cicero C |title=DNA Barcoding: Promise and Pitfalls |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=1529–31 |year=2004 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020354 |url=http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-pdf&amp;file=10.1371_journal.pbio.0020354-L.pdf |format=PDF fulltext |pmid=15486587 |pmc=519004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have questioned the efficacy of DNA barcoding by suggesting that other avian data is inconsistent with Hebert ''et al.'''s interpretation, namely, Johnson and Cicero's (2004&lt;ref name=JohnsonCicero&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnson NK, Cicero C |title=New mitochondrial DNA data affirm the importance of Pleistocene speciation in North American birds |journal=Evolution |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=1122–30 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15212392 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) finding that 74% of sister species comparisons fall below the 2.7% threshold suggested by Hebert ''et al.'' These criticisms are somewhat misleading considering that, of the 39 species comparisons reported by Johnson and Cicero, only 8 actually use COI data to arrive at their conclusions. Johnson and Cicero (2004&lt;ref name=JohnsonCicero/&gt;) have also claimed to have detected bird species with identical DNA barcodes, however, these 'barcodes' refer to an unpublished 723-bp sequence of ND6 which has never been suggested as a likely candidate for DNA barcoding.

The DNA barcoding debate resembles the [[phenetics]] debate of decades gone by. It remains to be seen whether what is now touted as a revolution in taxonomy will eventually go the same way as phenetic approaches, of which was claimed exactly the same decades ago, but which were all but rejected when they failed to live up to overblown expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Will KW, Mishler BD, Wheeler QD |title=The Perils of DNA Barcoding and the Need for Integrative Taxonomy |journal=Syst. Biol. |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=844–51 |year=2005 |doi=10.1080/10635150500354878 |url=http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/~w3bio/bio443/seminar_papers/perils_of_dna_barcoding.pdf|format=PDF |pmid=16243769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy surrounding DNA barcoding stems not so much from the method itself, but rather from extravagant claims that it will supersede or radically transform traditional taxonomy. Other critics fear a &quot;[[big science]]&quot; initiative like barcoding will make funding even more scarce for already underfunded disciplines like [[taxonomy]], but barcoders respond that they compete for funding not with fields like taxonomy, but instead with other big science fields, such as [[medicine]] and [[genomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregory TR |title=DNA barcoding does not compete with taxonomy |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue=7037 |pages=1067 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15858548 |doi=10.1038/4341067b |url=http://www.bolinfonet.org/pdf/DNA_barcoding_does_not_compete_with_taxonomy.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcoders also maintain that they are being dragged into [[species problem|long-standing debates over the definition of a species]] and that barcoding is less controversial when viewed primarily as a method of identification, not classification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kress&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;miller2007&quot; /&gt;

The current trend appears to be that DNA barcoding needs to be used alongside traditional [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] tools and alternative forms of molecular systematics so that problem cases can be identified and errors detected. Non-cryptic species can generally be resolved by either traditional or molecular taxonomy without ambiguity. However, more difficult cases will only yield to a combination of approaches. And finally, as most of the global [[biodiversity]] remains unknown, molecular barcoding can only hint at the existence of new taxa, but not delimit or describe them (DeSalle, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Desalle R |title=Species discovery versus species identification in DNA barcoding efforts: response to Rubinoff |journal=Conserv.

==DNA Barcoding Software==
Software for DNA barcoding requires integration of a field information management system (FIMS), laboratory information management system (LIMS), sequence analysis tools, workflow tracking to connect field data and laboratory data, database submission tools and pipeline automation for scaling up to eco-system scale projects. [[Geneious|Geneious Pro]] can be used for the sequence analysis components, and the two plugins made freely available through the Moorea Biocode Project, the [http://software.mooreabiocode.org/index.php?title=Main_Page|Geneious Biocode LIMS and Genbank Submission] plugins handle integration with the FIMS, the LIMS, workflow tracking and database submission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41620">A '''DNA microarray''' (also commonly known as gene chip, DNA chip, or [[biochip]]) is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the [[Gene Expression|expression]] levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. Each DNA spot contains [[pico]][[Mole (unit)|mole]]s (10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; moles) of a specific DNA sequence, known as ''[[Hybridization probe|probe]]s'' (or  ''reporters''). These can be a short section of a [[gene]] or other DNA element that are used to [[Nucleic acid hybridization#Hybridization|hybridize]] a [[cDNA]] or cRNA &lt;!--Agilent kit--&gt; sample (called ''target'') under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by detection of [[fluorophore]]-, silver-, or [[chemiluminescence]]-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target.
== The basic microarray ==
Since an array can contain tens of thousands of probes, a microarray experiment can accomplish many [[genetic test]]s in parallel. Therefore arrays have dramatically accelerated many types of investigation. In standard microarrays, the probes are [[oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesized]] and then attached via [[surface engineering]] to a solid surface by a [[covalent bond]] to a chemical matrix (via [[epoxy]]-silane, [[amine|amino]]-silane, [[lysine]], [[polyacrylamide]] or others). The solid surface can be [[glass]] or a silicon chip, in which case they are colloquially known as an ''Affy chip'' when an [[Affymetrix]] chip is used. Other microarray platforms, such as [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]], use microscopic beads, instead of the large solid support. Alternatively, microarrays can be constructed by the direct [[oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesis of oligonucleotide probes]] on solid surfaces. DNA arrays are different from other types of microarray only in that they either measure DNA or use DNA as part of its detection system.

DNA microarrays can be used to measure changes in [[Gene expression|expression]] levels, to detect [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs), or to genotype or resequence mutant genomes (''see [[DNA microarray#Uses_and_types|uses and types]] section''). Microarrays also differ in fabrication, workings, accuracy, efficiency, and cost (''see [[DNA_microarray#Fabrication|fabrication]] section'').  Additional factors for microarray experiments are the experimental design and the methods of analyzing the data (''see [[DNA_microarray#Microarrays_and_bioinformatics|Bioinformatics]] section'').

{{Main|Nucleic acid hybridization}}
{{Details|DNA microarray experiment}}
&lt;!-- KEEP SECTION SIMPLE --&gt;
The core principle behind microarrays is hybridization between two DNA strands, the property of [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] nucleic acid sequences to specifically pair with each other by forming [[hydrogen bond]]s between complementary [[Nucleotide|nucleotide base pairs]]. A high number of complementary base pairs in a nucleotide sequence means tighter [[non-covalent]] bonding between the two strands. After washing off of non-specific bonding sequences, only strongly paired strands will remain hybridized. So fluorescently labeled target sequences that bind to a probe sequence generate a signal that depends on the strength of the hybridization determined by the number of paired bases, the hybridization conditions (such as temperature), and washing after hybridization. Total strength of the signal, from a spot (feature), depends upon the amount of target sample binding to the probes present on that spot. Microarrays use relative quantization in which the intensity of a feature is compared to the intensity of the same feature under a different condition, &lt;!-- 2 channel experiments are mentioned below! so do not repeat --&gt; and the identity of the feature is known by its position.

== Uses and types ==
[[Image:Affymetrix-microarray.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Two Affymetrix chips. A [[match]] is shown at bottom left for size comparison.]]
Many types of array exist and the broadest distinction is whether they are spatially arranged on a surface or on coded beads:
* The traditional solid-phase array is a collection of orderly microscopic &quot;spots&quot;, called features, each with a specific probe attached to a solid surface, such as [[glass]], [[plastic]] or [[silicon]] [[biochip]] (commonly known as a  ''genome chip'', ''DNA chip'' or ''gene array'').  Thousands of them can be placed in known locations on a single DNA microarray.
* The alternative bead array is a collection of microscopic polystyrene beads, each with a specific probe and a ratio of two or more dyes, which do not interfere with the fluorescent dyes used on the target sequence.

DNA microarrays can be used to detect DNA (as in [[comparative genomic hybridization]]), or detect RNA (most commonly as [[cDNA]] after [[reverse transcription]]) that may or may not be translated into proteins.  The process of measuring gene expression via cDNA is called [[gene expression|expression analysis]] or [[expression profiling]].

|-
| [[Gene expression profiling]]
| In an [[mRNA]] or [[gene expression profiling]] experiment the [[Gene expression|expression]] levels of thousands of genes are simultaneously monitored to study the effects of certain treatments, [[disease]]s, and developmental stages on gene expression. For example, microarray-based gene expression profiling can be used to identify genes whose expression is changed in response to [[pathogens]] or other organisms by comparing gene expression in infected to that in uninfected cells or tissues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adomas et al.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Adomas A, Heller G, Olson A, Osborne J, Karlsson M, Nahalkova J, Van Zyl L, Sederoff R, Stenlid J, Finlay R, Asiegbu FO|year=2008|title=Comparative analysis of transcript abundance in Pinus sylvestris after challenge with a saprotrophic, pathogenic or mutualistic fungus|journal=Tree Physiol.|volume=28|pages=885–897|pmid=18381269|issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| GeneID
| Small microarrays to check IDs of organisms in food and feed (like [[GMO]] [http://bgmo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/home/docs.htm]), [[mycoplasms]] in cell culture, or [[pathogens]] for disease detection, mostly combining [[PCR]] and microarray technology.
|-
| [[ChIP-on-chip|Chromatin immunoprecipitation on Chip]]
| DNA sequences bound to a particular protein can be isolated by [[immunoprecipitation|immunoprecipitating]] that protein ([[Chromatin immunoprecipitation|ChIP]]), these fragments can be then hybridized to a microarray (such as a [[tiling array]]) allowing the determination of protein binding site occupancy throughout the genome. Example protein to [[Chromatin immunoprecipitation|immunoprecipitate]] are histone modifications (H3K27me3, H3K4me2, H3K9me3, etc.), [[Polycomb-group protein]] (PRC2:Suz12, PRC1:YY1) and [[trithorax-group protein]] (Ash1) to study the [[epigenetics|epigenetic landscape]] or [[RNA Polymerase II]] to study the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription landscape]].
|-
| [[DamID]]
| Analogously to [[ChIP]], genomic regions bound by a protein of interest can be isolated and used to probe a microarray to determine binding site occupancy. Unlike ChIP, DamID does not require antibodies but makes use of adenine methylation near the protein's binding sites to selectively amplify those regions, introduced by expressing minute amounts of protein of interest fused to bacterial [[Dam (methylase)|DNA adenine methyltransferase]].

| [[Alternative splicing]] detection
| An '''[[exon junction array]]'' design uses probes specific to the expected or potential splice sites of predicted [[exon]]s for a gene.  It is of intermediate density, or coverage, to a typical gene expression array (with 1-3 probes per gene) and a genomic tiling array (with hundreds or thousands of probes per gene).  It is used to assay the expression of alternative splice forms of a gene. [[Exon array]]s have a different design, employing probes designed to detect each individual exon for known or predicted genes, and can be used for detecting different splicing isoforms.
|-
| [[Fusion gene]]s microarray
| A Fusion gene microarray can detect fusion transcripts, ''e.g.'' from cancer specimens. The principle behind this is building on the [[alternative splicing]] microarrays. The oligo design strategy enables combined measurements of chimeric transcript junctions with exon-wise measurements of individual fusion partners.
|-
| [[Tiling array]]
| Genome tiling arrays consist of overlapping probes designed to densely represent a genomic region of interest, sometimes as large as an entire human chromosome. The purpose is to empirically detect expression of [[mRNA|transcripts]] or [[Alternative splicing|alternatively splice forms]] which may not have been previously known or predicted.

=== Fabrication ===
Microarrays can be manufactured in different ways, depending on the number of probes under examination, costs, customization requirements, and the type of scientific question being asked.  Arrays may have as few as 10 probes or up to 2.1 million micrometre-scale probes from commercial vendors.
&lt;!-- Repetition of second paragraph but less detail
=== Surface engineering ===

The first step of DNA microarray fabrication involves [[surface engineering]] of a substrate in order to obtain desirable surface properties for the application of interest.  Optimal surface properties are those which produce high signal to noise ratios for the DNA targets of interest.  Generally, this involves maximizing the probe surface density and activity while minimizing the non-specific binding of the targets of interest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}  Methods of surface engineering vary depending on the platform material, design, and application.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

=== Spotted vs. in situ synthesised arrays ===
[[Image:Microarray printing.ogg|thumb|300px|A DNA microarray being printed by a [[robot]] at the [[University of Delaware]]]]

Microarrays can be fabricated using a variety of technologies, including printing with fine-pointed pins onto glass slides, [[photolithography]] using pre-made masks, photolithography using dynamic micromirror devices, ink-jet printing,&lt;ref&gt;J Biochem Biophys Methods. 2000 Mar 16;42(3):105-10.  DNA-printing: utilization of a standard inkjet printer for the transfer of nucleic acids to solid supports.  Goldmann T, Gonzalez JS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/8/R58  | journal=Genome Biology | title=POSaM: a fast, flexible, open-source, inkjet oligonucleotide synthesizer and microarrayer| author=Lausted C et al.| volume = 5 | pages=R58 | doi=10.1186/gb-2004-5-8-r58 | pmid=15287980 | year=2004| issue=8| pmc=507883}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[electrochemistry]] on microelectrode arrays.

In ''spotted microarrays'', the probes are [[oligonucleotide synthesis|oligonucleotide]]s, [[cDNA]] or small fragments of [[PCR]] products that correspond to [[mRNA]]s.  The probes are [[oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesized]] prior to deposition on the array surface and are then &quot;spotted&quot; onto glass.  A common approach utilizes an array of fine pins or needles controlled by a robotic arm that is dipped into wells containing DNA probes and then depositing each probe at designated locations on the array surface.  The resulting &quot;grid&quot; of probes represents the nucleic acid profiles of the prepared probes and is ready to receive complementary cDNA or cRNA &quot;targets&quot; derived from experimental or clinical samples.
This technique is used by research scientists around the world to produce &quot;in-house&quot; printed microarrays from their own labs. These arrays may be easily customized for each experiment, because researchers can choose the probes and printing locations on the arrays, synthesize the probes in their own lab (or collaborating facility), and spot the arrays. They can then generate their own labeled samples for hybridization, hybridize the samples to the array, and finally scan the arrays with their own equipment. This provides a relatively low-cost microarray that may be customized for each study, and avoids the costs of purchasing often more expensive commercial arrays that may represent vast numbers of genes that are not of interest to the investigator.
Publications exist which indicate in-house spotted microarrays may not provide the same level of sensitivity compared to commercial oligonucleotide arrays,&lt;ref name=&quot;TRC Standardization&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|year= 2005|title=Standardizing global gene expression analysis between laboratories and across platforms|journal=Nat Methods|volume=2|pages=351–356|pmid=15846362|doi=10.1038/nmeth0605-477a|last12= Deng|first12= S|last13= Dressman|first13= HK|last14= Fannin|first14= RD|last15= Farin|first15= FM|last16= Freedman|first16= JH|last17= Fry|first17= RC|last18= Harper|first18= A|last19= Humble|first19= MC|last20= Hurban|first20= P|last21= Kavanagh|first21= TJ|last22= Kaufmann|first22= WK|first23= KF|first24= L|first25= JA|first26= MR|last27= Li|first27= J|first28= YJ|last29= Lobenhofer|first29= EK|last30= Lu|last31= Malek|first31= RL|last32= Milton|first32= S|last33= Nagalla|first33= SR|last34= O'malley|first34= JP|last35= Palmer|first35= VS|last36= Pattee|first36= P|last7= Paules|first7= RS|last38= Perou|first38= CM|last9= Phillips|first39= K|last40= Qin|last41= Qiu|first41= Y|last42= Quigley|first42= SD|last43= Rodland|first43= M|last44= Rusyn|first44= I|last45= Samson|first45= LD|last46= Schwartz|last47= Shi|first47= Y|last48= Shin|last49= Sieber|last50= Slifer|last51= Speer|first51= MC|last52= Spencer|first52= PS|last53= Sproles|first53= DI|last54= Swenberg|first54= JA|last55= Suk|first55= WA|last56= Sullivan|first56= RC|last57= Tian|first57= R|last58= Tennant|first58= RW|last59= Todd|first59= SA|last60= Tucker|first60= CJ|last61= Van Houten|first61= B|last62= Weis|first62= BK|last63= Xuan|first63= S|last64= Zarbl|first64= H|last65= Members Of The Toxicogenomics Research|first65= Consortium|issue= 5|author1= Bammler T, Beyer RP|author2= Consortium, Members of the Toxicogenomics Research|last3= Kerr|last4= Jing|last5= Lapidus|last6= Lasarev|last8= Li|first3= X|first4= LX|first6= DA|first8= JL|first9= SO|first5= S}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly owing to the small batch sizes and reduced printing efficiencies when compared to industrial manufactures of oligo arrays.

In ''oligonucleotide microarrays'', the probes are short sequences designed to match parts of the sequence of known or predicted [[open reading frame]]s.  Although oligonucleotide probes are often used in &quot;spotted&quot; microarrays, the term &quot;oligonucleotide array&quot; most often refers to a specific technique of manufacturing.  Oligonucleotide arrays are produced by printing short oligonucleotide sequences designed to represent a single gene or family of gene splice-variants by [[oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesizing]] this sequence directly onto the array surface instead of depositing intact sequences.  Sequences may be longer (60-mer probes such as the [[Agilent]] design) or shorter (25-mer probes produced by [[Affymetrix]]) depending on the desired purpose; longer probes are more specific to individual target genes, shorter probes may be spotted in higher density across the array and are cheaper to manufacture.
One technique used to produce oligonucleotide arrays include [[photolithographic]] synthesis (Affymetrix) on a silica substrate where light and light-sensitive masking agents are used to &quot;build&quot; a sequence one nucleotide at a time across the entire array.&lt;ref name=&quot;Affy PNAS Paper&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pease AC, Solas D, Sullivan EJ, Cronin MT, Holmes CP, Fodor SP.|year= 1994|title=Light-generated oligonucleotide arrays for rapid DNA sequence analysis|journal=PNAS|volume=91|pages=5022–5026|pmid=8197176|doi=10.1073/pnas.91.11.5022|issue=11|pmc=43922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each applicable probe is selectively &quot;unmasked&quot; prior to bathing the array in a solution of a single nucleotide, then a masking reaction takes place and the next set of probes are unmasked in preparation for a different nucleotide exposure.

=== Two-channel vs. one-channel detection ===
[[Image:Microarray-schema.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of typical dual-colour [[DNA microarray experiment|microarray experiment]].]]
&lt;!--- channel is the correct word and colour is a bit wrong semantically, see discussion ---&gt;
''Two-color microarrays'' or ''two-channel microarrays'' are typically [[DNA hybridization|hybridized]] with cDNA prepared from two samples to be compared (e.g. diseased tissue versus healthy tissue) and that are labeled with two different [[fluorophore]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shalon et al.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shalon D, Smith SJ, Brown PO|year= 1996|title=A DNA microarray system for analyzing complex DNA samples using two-color fluorescent probe hybridization|journal=Genome Res|volume=6|pages=639–645|pmid=8796352|doi=10.1101/gr.6.7.639|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluorescence|Fluorescent]] dyes commonly used for cDNA labeling include [[Cyanine|Cy]]3, which has a fluorescence emission wavelength of 570&amp;nbsp;nm (corresponding to the green part of the light spectrum), and [[Cyanine|Cy]]5 with a fluorescence emission wavelength of 670&amp;nbsp;nm (corresponding to the red part of the light spectrum). The two Cy-labeled cDNA samples are mixed and hybridized to a single microarray that is then scanned in a microarray scanner to visualize fluorescence of the two fluorophores after [[Excited state|excitation]] with a [[laser]] beam of a defined wavelength. Relative intensities of each fluorophore may then be used in ratio-based analysis to identify up-regulated and down-regulated genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang et al.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tang T, François N, Glatigny A, Agier N, Mucchielli MH, Aggerbeck L, Delacroix H|year= 2007|title=Expression ratio evaluation in two-colour microarray experiments is significantly improved by correcting image misalignment|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=23|pages=2686–2691|pmid=17698492|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btm399|issue=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oligonucleotide microarrays often carry control probes designed to hybridize with [[RNA spike-in]]s. The degree of hybridization between the spike-ins and the control probes is used to [[Normalization (statistics)|normalize]] the hybridization measurements for the target probes. Although absolute levels of gene expression may be determined in the two-color array in rare instances, the relative differences in expression among different spots within a sample and between samples is the preferred method of [[data analysis]] for the two-color system. Examples of providers for such microarrays includes [[Agilent]] with their Dual-Mode platform, [[Eppendorf (company)|Eppendorf]] with their DualChip platform for colorimetric [[Silverquant]] labeling, and TeleChem International with [[Arrayit]].

In ''single-channel microarrays'' or ''one-color microarrays'', the arrays provide intensity data for each probe or probe set indicating a relative level of hybridization with the labeled target.  However, they do not truly indicate abundance levels of a gene but rather relative abundance when compared to other samples or conditions when processed in the same experiment. Each RNA molecule encounters protocol and batch-specific bias during amplification, labeling, and hybridization phases of the experiment making comparisons between genes for the same microarray uninformative.  The comparison of two conditions for the same gene requires two separate single-dye hybridizations.   Several popular single-channel systems are the Affymetrix &quot;Gene Chip&quot;, Illumina &quot;Bead Chip&quot;, Agilent single-channel arrays, the Applied Microarrays &quot;CodeLink&quot; arrays, and the Eppendorf &quot;DualChip &amp; Silverquant&quot;.  One strength of the single-dye system lies in the fact that an aberrant sample cannot affect the raw data derived from other samples, because each array chip is exposed to only one sample (as opposed to a two-color system in which a single low-quality sample may drastically impinge on overall data precision even if the other sample was of high quality).  Another benefit is that data are more easily compared to arrays from different experiments so long as batch effects have been accounted for. A drawback to the one-color system is that, when compared to the two-color system, twice as many microarrays are needed to compare samples within an experiment.

== Microarrays and bioinformatics ==

[[Image:Heatmap.png|right|thumb|160px|Gene expression values from microarray experiments can be represented as [[heat map]]s to visualize the result of data analysis.]]

The advent of inexpensive microarray experiments created several specific bioinformatics challenges:

* the multiple levels of replication in experimental design ([[#Experimental design|Experimental design]])
* the number of platforms and independent groups and data format ([[#Standardization|Standardization]])
* the treatment of the data ([[#Statistical analysis|Statistical analysis]])
* accuracy and precision ([[#Relation between probe and gene|Relation between probe and gene]])
* the sheer volume of data and the ability to share it ([[#Data warehousing|Data warehousing]])

=== Experimental design ===
Due to the biological complexity of gene expression, the considerations of experimental design that are discussed in the [[expression profiling]] article are of critical importance if statistically and biologically valid conclusions are to be drawn from the data.

There are three main elements to consider when designing a microarray experiment. First, replication of the biological samples is essential for drawing conclusions from the experiment. Second, technical replicates (two RNA samples obtained from each experimental unit) help to ensure precision and allow for testing differences within treatment groups. The biological replicates include independent RNA extractions and technical replicates may be two [[aliquots]] of the same extraction. Third, spots of each cDNA clone or oligonucleotide are present as replicates (at least duplicates) on the microarray slide, to provide a measure of technical precision in each hybridization. It is critical that information about the sample preparation and handling is discussed, in order to help identify the independent units in the experiment and to avoid inflated estimates of [[statistical significance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Churchill GA| title=Fundamentals of experimental design for cDNA microarrays | journal=Nature genetics supplement | volume =32 | year=2002 | doi=10.1038/ng1031| url=http://www.vmrf.org/research-websites/gcf/Forms/Churchill.pdf| pages=490–5| format =  &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AFundamentals+of+experimental+design+for+cDNA+microarrays&amp;as_publication=Nature+genetics+suppliment&amp;as_ylo=2002&amp;as_yhi=2002&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;| pmid = 12454643| last1 = Churchill| first1 = GA| issue = }} {{Dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standardization ===

Microarray data is difficult to exchange due to the lack of standardization in platform fabrication, assay protocols, and analysis methods.  This presents an [[interoperability]] problem in [[bioinformatics]]. Various [[grass-roots]] [[open source|open-source]] projects are trying to ease the exchange and analysis of data produced with non-proprietary chips:
* For example, the &quot;Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment&quot; ([[MIAME]]) checklist helps define the level of detail that should exist and is being adopted by many [[Scientific journal|journals]] as a requirement for the submission of papers incorporating microarray results.  But MIAME does not describe the format for the information, so while many formats can support the MIAME requirements, {{as of|lc=y|2007}} no format permits verification of complete semantic compliance.
* The &quot;MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) Project&quot; is being conducted by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to develop standards and quality control metrics which will eventually allow the use of MicroArray data in drug discovery, clinical practice and regulatory decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/nctr/science/centers/toxicoinformatics/maqc/ NCTR Center for Toxicoinformatics - MAQC Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[MGED Society]] has developed standards for the representation of gene expression experiment results and relevant annotations.

=== Statistical analysis ===
{{see also|Gene chip analysis}}

Microarray data sets are commonly very large, and analytical precision is influenced by a number of variables. [[Statistics|Statistical]] challenges include taking into account effects of background noise and appropriate [[Normalization (statistics)|normalization]] of the data.

===Relation between probe and gene===
The relation between a probe and the [[mRNA]] that it is expected to detect is not trivial. Some mRNAs may cross-hybridize probes in the array that are supposed to detect another mRNA. In addition, mRNAs may experience amplification bias that is sequence or molecule-specific.  Thirdly, probes that are designed to detect the mRNA of a particular gene may be relying on genomic [[Expressed sequence tag|EST]] information that is incorrectly associated with that gene.

===Data warehousing===
Microarray data was found to be more useful when compared to other similar datasets.  The sheer volume of data, specialized formats (such as [[MIAME]]), and curation efforts associated with the datasets require specialized databases to store the data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1117">'''Naked DNA''' is [[histone]]-free [[DNA]] that is passed from cell to cell during a gene transfer process called [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] or [[transfection]].  In transformation, purified or naked DNA is taken up by the recipient cell which will give the recipient cell a new characteristic or [[phenotype]]. Transfection differs from transformation since the DNA is not generally incorporated into the cell's genome, it is only transiently expressed.

In the field of DNA vaccines or genetic immunization, the term &quot;naked DNA&quot; was coined by Vical to mean DNA delivered free from agents which promote transfection. Research on the use of naked DNA for [[DNA vaccination]]s and [[gene therapy]] has shown some initial success, but have not yet resulted in any generally available therapy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56831">[[File:DNA tetrahedron white.png|thumb|240px|DNA nanotechnology involves the creation of artificial, [[Nucleic acid design|designed]] nanostructures out of [[nucleic acids]], such as this [[DNA]] tetrahedron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman05&quot;/&gt; Each edge of the tetrahedron is a 20 [[base pair]] DNA [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]], and each vertex is a three-arm junction.]]

'''DNA nanotechnology''' is a branch of [[nanotechnology]] that specializes in the design and manufacture of artificial [[nucleic acid]] structures for technological uses.  The same properties that make nucleic acids useful as the carrier of genetic information in [[Cell (biology)|living cells]] serve it well as an non-biological engineering material: due to the specific [[base pair]]ing rules of nucleic acids, only portions of nucleic acid strands with [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[Nucleic acid sequence|base sequences]] bind together to form strong, rigid [[nucleic acid double helix]] molecules.  This property allows for [[Rational design|rational]] [[Nucleic acid design|design]] of base sequences so that a set of strands will assemble to form a desired target structure, leading to a unique ability to form designed, complex structures with precise control over nanoscale features.  [[DNA]] is the dominant material used, but structures incorporating other nucleic acids such as [[RNA]] and [[peptide nucleic acid]] (PNA) have also been constructed, leading to occasional use of the alternate name '''nucleic acid nanotechnology''' to describe the field.

The conceptual foundation for DNA nanotechnology was first laid out by [[Nadrian Seeman]] in the early 1980s, and the field began to attract widespread interest in the early to mid 2000s.  Among the field's results are the creation of static structures such as two- and three-dimensional [[Crystal structure|crystal lattices]], nanotubes, [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]], and arbitrary shapes made by the [[DNA origami]] method; as well as functional structures such as [[molecular machine]]s and [[DNA computing|DNA computers]].  The field is beginning to be used as a tool to solve [[basic science]] problems in [[structural biology]] and [[biophysics]], including applications in [[X-ray crystallography|crystallography]] and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins|spectroscopy]] for protein structure determination.  Potential real-world applications in [[molecular scale electronics]] and [[nanomedicine]] are also being investigated.

==Fundamental concepts==

The goal of [[nanotechnology]] is to construct materials and devices with features on a scale less than 100 [[nanometer]]s.  DNA nanotechnology is an example of the [[molecular self-assembly]] approach to nanotechnology, where pre-existing molecular components spontaneously form a larger, organized structure due to their physical and chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;'''Background:''' {{cite book |last=Pelesko |first=John A. |title=Self-assembly: the science of things that put themselves together |year=2007 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=New York |isbn=978 1 58488 687 7 |pages=5, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nucleic acids such as DNA are well-suited to nanoscale construction, as a [[nucleic acid double helix]] has a diameter of 2 nm and a helical repeat length of 3.5 nm.  The key property which makes nucleic acids more useful for constructing structures than other materials is that the binding between two nucleic acid strands depends on simple [[base pair]]ing rules which are well understood, and form a specific structure upon binding, making the assembly of nucleic acid structures easy to control through [[nucleic acid design]].  This property is absent in other materials used in nanotechnology, including [[protein]]s, for which [[protein design]] is very difficult, and [[nanoparticle]]s, which lack the capability for specific assembly on their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seeman2010&quot;/&gt;

The [[Nucleic acid structure|structure]] of a nucleic acid molecule consists of a sequence of [[nucleotide]]s, distinguished by which [[nucleobase]] they contain. In DNA, the four bases present are [[adenine]] (A), [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G), and [[thymine]] (T).  Nucleic acids have the property that two molecules will bind to each other to form a double helix only if the two sequences are [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]], meaning that they form matching sequences of base pairs, with A only binding to T, and C only to G.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seeman2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Background:''' {{cite book|last=Long|first=Eric C.|chapter=Fundamentals of nucleic acids |editor1-first=Sidney M |editor1-last=Hecht |title=Bioorganic chemistry: nucleic acids|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York |isbn=0195084675|pages=4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the formation of correctly matched base pairs is [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics|energetically favorable]], nucleic acid strands are expected in most cases to bind to each other in the conformation that maximizes the number of correctly paired bases.  The sequences of bases in a system of strands thus determine the pattern of binding and the overall structure in an easily controllable way.  In DNA nanotechnology, the base sequences of strands are rationally designed by researchers so that the base pairing interactions cause the strands to assemble in the desired conformation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seeman2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seeman-sciam&quot;/&gt;

DNA nanotechnology is sometimes divided into two overlapping subfields: structural DNA nanotechnology and dynamic DNA nanotechnology.  Structural DNA nanotechnology, sometimes abbreviated as SDN, focuses on synthesizing and characterizing nucleic acid complexes and materials which assemble into a static, [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] end state.  On the other hand, dynamic DNA nanotechnology focuses on complexes with useful non-equilibrium behavior such as the ability to reconfigure based on a chemical or physical stimulus.  Some complexes combine features of both the structural and dynamic subfields, such as nucleic acid nanomechanical devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDNreview&quot;&gt;'''Dynamic DNA nanotechnology:''' {{Cite doi|10.1038/nchem.957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SDNreview&quot;/&gt;

The complexes constructed in structural DNA nanotechnology make use of branched nucleic acid structures containing junctions, unlike most biological DNA, which exists as an unbranched [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]].  One of the simplest branched structures, and the first made, is a four-arm junction that consists of four individual DNA strands, portions of which are complementary in a specific pattern. Unlike in natural [[Holliday junction]]s, each arm in the artificial immobile four-arm junction has a different [[Nucleic acid sequence|base sequence]], causing the junction point to be fixed at a certain position.  Multiple junctions can also be combined in the same molecule; the most widely used of these is the &quot;double-crossover&quot; (DX) [[Structural motif|motif]]. A DX molecule can be imagined as containing two parallel double helical domains, where individual strands cross from one domain into the other at two crossover points.  Each crossover point is itself topologically a four-arm junction, but ones which are constrained to a single orientation, as opposed to the flexible single four-arm junction.  This rigidity makes the DX motif suitable as a structural building block for larger DNA complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seeman2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seeman-sciam&quot;/&gt;

Dynamic DNA nanotechnology often uses a mechanism called toehold-mediated strand displacement to allow the nucleic acid complexes to reconfigure.  In this reaction, a strand binds to a a [[Sticky end|single-stranded toehold region]] of a double-stranded complex, and then displaces one of the strands bound in the original complex.  The presence of the extra strand thus acts as a switch to control the reconfiguration.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDNreview&quot;/&gt;  In addition, reconfigurable structures and devices can be made using functional nucleic acids such as [[deoxyribozyme]]s and [[ribozyme]]s, which are capable of performing chemical reactions, and [[aptamer]]s, which can bind to specific proteins or small molecules.&lt;ref&gt;'''Dynamic DNA nanotechnology:''' {{Cite doi|10.1016/j.copbio.2006.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

DNA nanostructures must be [[Rational design|rationally designed]] so that the individual nucleic acid strands will assemble into the desired structures. This process usually begins with the specification of a desired target structure or functionality. Then, the overall [[Nucleic acid secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the target molecule is determined, specifying the arrangement of nucleic acid strands within the structure, and which portions of those strands should be bound to each other. The last step is the [[Nucleic acid primary structure|primary structure]] design, which is the specification of the actual base sequences of each nucleic acid strand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldkamp&quot;&gt;'''Design:''' {{Cite doi|10.1002/anie.200502358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brenneman02&quot;/&gt;

===Structural design===

The first step in designing a nucleic acid nanostructure is to decide how a given structure should be represented by a specific arrangement of nucleic acid strands. This design step determines the secondary structure, or the series of base pairs that hold the individual strands together in the desired shape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldkamp&quot;/&gt;  Several approaches have been demonstrated:

*'''Tile-based structures.''' This approach breaks the target structure into smaller units with strong binding between the strands contained in each unit, and weaker interactions between the units. It is often used to make periodic lattices, but can also be used to implement algorithmic self-assembly, making them one platform for [[DNA computing]].  This was the dominant design strategy used from the mid 1990s until the mid 2000s, when the DNA origami methodology was developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldkamp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Overview:''' {{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cphc.200600260 |title=DNA tile based self-assembly: building complex nanoarchitectures |date=11 August 2006 |last1=Lin |first1=Chenxiang |last2=Liu |first2=Yan |last3=Rinker |first3=Sherri |last4=Yan |first4=Hao |journal=ChemPhysChem |volume=7 |pages=1641–1647 |pmid=16832805 |issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Folding structures.''' An alternative to the tile-based approach, folding approaches make the nanostructure out of a single long strand. This long strand can either have a designed sequence that folds due to its interactions with itself, or it can be folded into the desired shape by using shorter, &quot;staple&quot; strands. This latter method is called [[DNA origami]], which allows the creation of [[nanoscale]] two- and three-dimensional shapes (see [[#Arbitrary shapes|Arbitrary shapes]] below).&lt;ref name=&quot;ShihYanChallenges&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rothemundorigami&quot;&gt;'''DNA origami:''' {{cite journal |last=Rothemund |first=Paul W. K. |date=16 March 2006 |title=Folding DNA to create nanoscale shapes and patterns |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue= 7082|pages=297–302|pmid=16541064|doi=10.1038/nature04586|bibcode = 2006Natur.440..297R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dynamic assembly.''' This approach directly controls the kinetics of DNA self-assembly, specifying not only the fully formed product of the assembly reaction, but also all the [[Reaction intermediate|intermediate]] steps in the [[reaction mechanism]].  This is done using a [[Stem-loop|nucleic acid hairpin]] structure as the starting material, which assembles in a [[Biochemical cascade|cascade]] reaction in a specific order.  This class of methods has the advantage of proceeding isothermally, and thus does not involve the thermal [[Annealing (biology)|annealing]] step that is required by solely thermodynamic approaches.&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ShihYanChallenges&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Kinetic assembly:''' {{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature06451 |title=Programming biomolecular self-assembly pathways |date=17 January 2008 |last1=Yin |first1=Peng |last2=Choi |first2=Harry M. T. |last3=Calvert |first3=Colby R. |last4=Pierce |first4=Niles A. |journal=Nature |volume=451 |pages=318–322 |pmid=18202654 |issue=7176|bibcode = 2008Natur.451..318Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequence design===

{{main|Nucleic acid design}}

After any of the above approaches are used to design the secondary structure of a target molecule, an actual sequence of nucleotides must be devised that will form into the desired structure. Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid base sequence to each strand so that they will associate into a desired conformation.  Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure have the lowest energy, and is thus the most thermodynamically favorable, and misassembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored. This is done either through [[heuristic]] methods such as sequence symmetry minimization, or by explicitly using a full [[Nearest-neighbor thermodynamic parameters|nearest-neighbor]] thermodynamic model. Geometric models are used to examine [[Nucleic acid tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] of the nanostructures and ensure that the complexes are not overly [[Strain (chemistry)|strained]].&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brenneman02&quot;&gt;'''Design:''' {{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0304-3975(02)00135-4 |title=Strand design for biomolecular computation |date=25 September 2002 |last1=Brenneman |first1=Arwen |last2=Condon |first2=Anne |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |volume=287 |pages=39–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;paradigms&quot;/&gt;

Nucleic acid design has similar goals to [[protein design]]: in both, the sequence of monomers is designed to favor the desired folded or associated structure and to disfavor alternate structures. Nucleic acid design has the advantage of being much computationally simpler than protein design, since the simplicity of Watson-Crick base pairing rules leads to simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs. However, nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their functionality.&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;paradigms&quot;&gt;'''Design:''' {{cite journal |last=Dirks |first=Robert M. |coauthors=Lin, Milo; Winfree, Erik &amp; Pierce, Niles A. |date=15 February 2004 |title=Paradigms for computational nucleic acid design |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=1392–1403 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkh291|pmid=14990744 |pmc=390280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural DNA nanotechnology==

Structural DNA nanotechnology, sometimes abbreviated as SDN, focuses on synthesizing and characterizing nucleic acid complexes and materials with various nanoscale structures. Structural DNA nanotechnology is largely based on the fact that the three-dimensional structure of DNA—the [[nucleic acid double helix]]— has a robust, defined geometry that makes it possible to predict and design the structures of more complex DNA molecules. Many such structures have been created, including two- and three-dimensional structures; and periodic, aperiodic, and discrete structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDNreview&quot;&gt;'''Structural DNA nanotechnology:''' {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12033-007-0059-4 |title=An overview of structural DNA nanotechnology |month=November |year=2007 |last1=Seeman |first1=Nadrian C. |journal=Molecular Biotechnology |volume=37 |pages=246–257 |pmid=17952671 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller nucleic acid assemblies can be equipped with [[sticky ends]] in order to combine them into a two-dimensional periodic lattice. The earliest example of this was the array of DX, or double-crossover, molecules. Each DX molecule can be designed with four [[sticky end]]s, one at each end of the two [[Nucleic acid double helix|double-helical]] domains, and these sticky ends can be designed with sequences that cause the DX units to combine into a specific [[Tessellation|tessellated]] pattern. They thus form extended flat sheets that are essentially rigid two-dimensional [[crystal]]s of DNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDNreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--

Creating three-dimensional lattices out of DNA was the earliest goal of DNA nanotechnology, but proved to be one of the most difficult to realize.

===Nanotubes===
 
DX arrays have been made to form hollow nanotubes of 4–20 [[Nanometer|nm]] diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldkamp&quot;/&gt; These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to [[carbon nanotube]]s, but the carbon nanotubes are stronger and better conductors, whereas the DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures.

===Polyhedra===

A number of three-dimensional DNA molecules have been made that have the connectivity of a [[polyhedron]] such as an octahedron or cube. In other words, the DNA duplexes trace the edges of a polyhedron with a DNA junction at each vertex.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShihYanChallenges&quot;&gt;'''Overview:''' {{cite doi|10.1038/nnano.2011.187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest demonstrations of DNA polyhedra involved multiple [[DNA ligase|ligations]] and [[solid-phase synthesis]] steps to create [[Catenane|catenated]] polyhedra.&lt;!--

===Arbitrary shapes===
{{See also|DNA origami}}

Nanostructures of arbitrary shapes are usually made using the DNA origami method. DNA origami makes use of a long natural virus strand as a &quot;scaffold&quot; strand, and computationally designs shorter &quot;staple&quot; strands that bind to portions of the scaffold strand and force it to fold into the desired shape. This method has the advantage of being easy to design, as the [[Nucleic acid sequence|base sequence]] is predetermined by the scaffold strand sequence.  It also does not require high strand purity and accurate [[stoichiometry]], as most other DNA nanotechnology methods do. DNA origami was first demonstrated for two-dimensional shapes; demonstrated designs included the [[smiley face]] and a coarse [[map]] of [[North America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ShihYanChallenges&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rothemundorigami&quot;/&gt;

DNA origami was later extended to solid three-dimensional shapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShihYanChallenges&quot;/&gt;  One method creates solid shapes by filling the desired space with parallel DNA helices in a honeycomb pattern.&lt;ref name=origami&gt;'''DNA origami:''' {{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature08016 |title=Self-assembly of DNA into nanoscale three-dimensional shapes |date=21 May 2009 |last1=Douglas |first1=Shawn M. |last2=Dietz |first2=Hendrik |last3=Liedl |first3=Tim |last4=Högberg |first4=Björn |last5=Graf |first5=Franziska |last6=Shih |first6=William M. |journal=Nature |volume=459 |issue=7245 |pages=414–418 |pmid=19458720 |pmc=2688462|bibcode = 2009Natur.459..414D }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another approach uses structures with two-dimensional faces which fold into an overall three-dimensional shape, akin to a cardboard box.

==Functional nucleic acid nanostructures==

DNA nanotechnology focuses on creating molecules with designed functionalities as well as structures. These include both dynamic functionality within the nucleic acid structure itself, for example with computation and mechanical motion, as well as by including other components such as small molecules or nanoparticles which have their own functionalities. Many classes of functional systems have been demonstrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShihYanChallenges&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nanomachines&quot;/&gt;

===Nanoarchitecture===

The incorporation of molecules other than nucleic acids into these structures would allow materials and devices to be made with a range of functionalities much greater than is possible with nucleic acids alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShihYanChallenges&quot;/&gt;  While the idea of using DNA arrays to template the assembly of other functional molecules was first suggested by Bruche Robinson and Nadrian Seeman in 1987,&lt;!--

===Nanomechanical devices===

{{main|DNA machine}}

DNA complexes have been made that change their conformation upon some stimulus. These are intended to have applications in [[nanorobotics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nanomachines&quot;/&gt; Some of these DNA machines operate through a twisting motion. The first such device made use of the transition between the [[B-DNA]] and [[Z-DNA]] forms to respond to a change in buffer conditions.&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''DNA machines:''' {{cite journal |last=Mao |first=Chengde |coauthors=Sun, Weiqiong; Shen, Zhiyong; Seeman, Nadrian C. |date=14 January 1999 |title=A DNA nanomechanical device based on the B-Z transition |journal=Nature |volume=397 |issue= 6715|pages=144–146 |pmid=9923675|doi=10.1038/16437|bibcode = 1999Natur.397..144M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This reliance on buffer conditions, however, caused all devices to change state at the same time.

Another type of nucleic acid nanomachines, called DNA walkers, exhibit directional motion along a linear track.

==Applications==

DNA nanotechnology provides one of the only ways to form designed, complex structures with precise control over nanoscale features.  The field is beginning to see application to solve [[basic science]] problems in [[structural biology]] and [[biophysics]].  One such application, the earliest envisaged for the field, is in [[crystallography]], where molecules that are hard to crystallize by themselves could be arranged and oriented within a three-dimensional nucleic acid lattice, thus allowing determination of their structure.  DNA origami rods have also been used to replace [[liquid crystals]] in [[residual dipolar coupling]] experiments in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins|protein NMR spectroscopy]]; using DNA origami is advantageous because, unlike liquid crystals, they are tolerant of the detergents needed to suspend [[membrane protein]]s in solution.  It has been demonstrated that DNA walkers can be used as nanoscale [[assembly line]]s to move [[nanoparticle]]s and direct [[chemical synthesis]].  Furthermore, DNA origami structures have aided in the biophysical studies of [[enzyme]] function and [[protein folding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SDNreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;growsup&quot;/&gt;

DNA nanotechnology is also moving towards potential real-world applications.  It has been suggested that the ability of nucleic acid arrays to arrange other molecules has potential applications in [[molecular scale electronics]], with the assembly of a nucleic acid lattice templating the assembly of molecular electronic elements such as [[molecular wire]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDNreview&quot;/&gt;  It has been suggested that nucleic acid nanostructures could provide a method for nanometer-scale control of the placement and overall architecture of these components, essentially using nucleic acid structures as a molecular [[breadboard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ShihYanChallenges&quot;/&gt;  DNA nanotechnology has been called a form of [[programmable matter]] because of the coupling of computation to its material properties.&lt;ref&gt;'''Applications:''' {{cite book|last=Rietman|first=Edward A.|title=Molecular engineering of nanosystems|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-98988-4|pages=209–212|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ga2DKYCm7xMC&amp;pg=PA209|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are potential applications for DNA nanotechnology in [[nanomedicine]], making use of its ability to perform computation in a [[Biocompatibility|biocompatible]] format to make &quot;smart drugs&quot; for [[targeted drug delivery]].  One such system being investigated uses a hollow DNA box containing proteins that induce [[apoptosis]], or cell death, that will only open when in proximity to a [[cancer cell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;growsup&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Applications:''' {{cite journal |pmid=19404476 |month=March |year=2008 |last1=Jungmann |first1=Ralf |last2=Renner |first2=Stephan |last3=Simmel |first3=Friedrich C. |title=From DNA nanotechnology to synthetic biology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=99–109 |doi=10.2976/1.2896331 |pmc=2645571 |journal=HFSP journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has additionally been interest in expressing these artificial structures in engineered living bacterial cells, most likely using the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] RNA for the assembly, although it is unknown whether these complex structures are able to efficiently fold or assemble in the cell's [[cytoplasm]].  If successful, this could enable [[directed evolution]] of nucleic acid nanostructures.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShihYanChallenges&quot;/&gt;

==Materials and methods==

The sequences of the individual DNA strands that make up the target structure are designed computationally, using [[molecular modeling]] and [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics|thermodynamic modeling]] software.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brenneman02&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;paradigms&quot;/&gt;  Once the sequences have been designed, the nucleic acid molecules themselves are synthesized through standard [[oligonucleotide synthesis]] methods.  This process is usually automated by using a machine called an oligonucleotide synthesizer, and nucleic acids of custom sequence are commercially available from many vendors.&lt;ref&gt;'''Methods:''' {{Cite doi|10.1002/0471142727.mb0211s42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For methods that require pure strands of known concentration, the nucleic acid strands can be purified using [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] [[gel electrophoresis]],&lt;ref&gt;'''Methods:''' {{Cite doi|10.1002/0471142727.mb0212s42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and concentrations are determined by one of several [[nucleic acid quantitation]] methods using [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Methods:''' {{Cite doi|10.1002/9780470089941.et0202s5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fully formed target structures are usually characterized by [[Native state|native]] gel electrophoresis, which provides information about the size and shape of DNA molecules.  An [[electrophoretic mobility shift assay]] can indicate whether a structure incorporates all the individual desired strands.&lt;ref&gt;'''Methods:''' {{Cite doi|10.1002/0471142727.mb0207s47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fluorescent labeling]] and [[Förster resonance energy transfer]] (FRET) are sometimes used to characterize the structure of the molecules.&lt;ref&gt;'''Methods:''' {{Cite doi|10.1002/0471142700.nc1110s11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nucleic acid structures can be directly imaged by [[atomic force microscopy]], which is well suited to extended two-dimensional structures, but is less useful for discrete three-dimensional structures due to the interaction of the microscope tip with the fragile nucleic acid structure.  For these latter structures [[transmission electron microscopy]] and [[cryo-electron microscopy]] are important methods.  Extended three-dimensional lattices are analyzed by [[X-ray crystallography]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Methods:''' {{Cite doi|10.1007/978-1-61779-142-0_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Methods:''' {{cite book|last=Bloomfield|first=Victor A.|title=Nucleic acids: structures, properties, and functions|year=2000|publisher=University Science Books|location=Sausalito, Calif|isbn=0935702490|pages=84–86, 396–407|coauthors=Crothers, Donald M., Tinoco, Jr., Ignacio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Escher Depth.jpg|thumb|left|The woodcut ''Depth'' (pictured) by [[M. C. Escher]] reportedly inspired Nadrian Seeman to consider using three-dimensional lattices of DNA to orient hard-to-crystallize molecules. This led to the beginning of the field of DNA nanotechnology.]]

The conceptual foundation for DNA nanotechnology was first laid out by [[Nadrian Seeman]] in the early 1980s.&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pelesko&quot;&gt;'''History:''' {{cite book |last=Pelesko |first=John A. |title=Self-assembly: the science of things that put themselves together |year=2007 |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=New York |isbn=978 1 58488 687 7 |pages=201, 242, 259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeman's original motivation was to create a three-dimensional DNA lattice for orienting other large molecules, which would simplify their [[crystallography|crystallographic study]] by eliminating the difficult process of obtaining pure crystals.  This idea had reportedly come to him in late 1980, after realizing the similarity between the woodcut ''Depth'' by [[M. C. Escher]] and an array of DNA six-arm junctions.&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''History:''' See {{Cite web |url=http://seemanlab4.chem.nyu.edu/nano-pro.html |title=Current crystallization protocol |publisher=Nadrian Seeman Lab}} for a statement of the problem, and {{Cite web |url=http://seemanlab4.chem.nyu.edu/nano-cage.html |title=DNA cages containing oriented guests |publisher=Nadiran Seeman Laboratory}} for the proposed solution.&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of natural branched DNA molecules were known at the time, including the DNA [[replication fork]] and the mobile [[Holliday junction]], but Seeman's insight was that immobile nucleic acid junctions could be created by properly designing the strand sequences to remove symmetry in the assembled molecule, and that these immoble junctions could in principle be combined into rigid crystalline lattices.  The first theoretical paper proposing this scheme was published in 1982, and the first experimental demonstration of an immoble DNA junction was published the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShihYanChallenges&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seeman2010&quot;&gt;'''Overview:''' {{Cite doi|10.1146/annurev-biochem-060308-102244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeman's laboratory in 1991 published the synthesis of a [[cube]] made of DNA, the first synthetic three-dimensional nucleic acid nanostructure, for which he received the 1995 [[Foresight Institute Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology|Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology]], which was followed by a DNA [[truncated octahedron]]. However, it soon became clear that these molecules, polygonal shapes with flexible junctions as their [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]], were not rigid enough to form extended three-dimensional lattices. Seeman developed the more rigid double-crossover (DX) [[Structural motif|motif]], and in collaboration with [[Erik Winfree]], in 1998 published the creation of two-dimensional lattices of DX tiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seeman-sciam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pelesko&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;origamichapter&quot;/&gt;  The synthesis of a three-dimensional lattice was finally published by Seeman in 2009, nearly thirty years after he had set out to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;growsup&quot;/&gt;

These tile-based structures had the advantage that they provided the capability to implement [[DNA computing]], which was demonstrated by Winfree and [[Paul Rothemund]] in their 2004 paper on the algorithmic self-assembly of a Sierpinski gasket structure, and for which they shared the 2006 Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology. Winfree's key insight was that the DX tiles could be used as [[Wang tile]]s, meaning that their assembly was capable of performing computation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pelesko&quot;/&gt;

The first [[DNA machine|DNA nanomachine]]—a motif that changes its structure in response to an input—was demonstrated in 1999 by Seeman. An improved system was demonstrated by [[Bernard Yurke]] the following year, which was the first nucleic acid device to make use of [[toehold-mediated strand displacement]]. The next advance was to translate this into mechanical motion, and in 2004 and 2005, a number of DNA walker systems were demonstrated by the groups of Nadrian Seeman, [[Niles Pierce]], [[Andrew Turberfield]], and [[Chengde Mao]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nanomachines&quot;&gt;'''DNA machines:''' {{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.104 |title=DNA nanomachines |month=May |year=2007 |last1=Bath |first1=Jonathan |last2=Turberfield |first2=Andrew J. |journal=Nature Nanotechnology |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=275–284 |pmid=18654284|bibcode = 2007NatNa...2..275B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Rothemund first demonstrated the new [[DNA origami]] technique for easily and robustly creating folded DNA molecules of any shape. Rothemund had conceived of this method as being conceptually intermediate between Seeman's DX lattices, which used many short strands, and [[William Shih]]'s DNA octahedron, which consisted mostly of one very long strand; Rothemund's DNA origami contains a long strand whose folding is assisted by a number of short strands. This method allowed the creation of much larger structures than were previously possible, and which are less technically demanding to design and synthesize.&lt;ref name=&quot;origamichapter&quot;&gt;'''DNA origami:''' {{cite book |doi=10.1007/3-540-30296-4_1 |editor1-first=Junghuei |editor1-last=Chen |editor2-first=Natasha |editor2-last=Jonoska |editor3-first=Grzegorz |editor3-last=Rozenberg |title=Nanotechnology: science and computation |series=Natural Computing Series |year=2006 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=978 3 540 30295 7 |first=Paul W.

DNA nanotechnology as a field was initially met with some skepticism due to the unusual non-biological use of nucleic acids as a material for building structures and doing computation,  as well as the preponderance of [[proof of principle]] experiments that extended the capabilities of the field but were far from actual applications.  Seeman's seminal 1991 paper on the synthesis of the DNA cube was rejected by the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' after one reviewer praised its originality while another criticized it for its lack of biological relevance.  By the early 2010s, however, the field was considered to have increased its capabilities to the point that applications for basic science research were beginning to be realized, and practical applications in medicine and other fields were beginning to be considered feasible.&lt;ref name=&quot;growsup&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''History:''' {{cite journal|last=Hopkin|first=Karen|title=Profile: 3-D seer|journal=The Scientist|year=2011|month=August|url=http://the-scientist.com/2011/08/01/3-d-seer/|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field had grown from very few active laboratories in 2001, to at least 60 in 2010, which increased the talent pool and thus the number of scientific advances in the field during that decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeemanGrowing&quot;&gt;'''History:''' {{cite journal|last=Seeman|first=Nadrian|title=Structural DNA nanotechnology: growing along with Nano Letters|journal=Nano Letters|doi=10.1021/nl101262u |date=9 June 2010 |volume=10|issue=6|pages=1971–1978|pmid=20486672|pmc=2901229|bibcode = 2010NanoL..10.1971S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[molecular biology]], '''DNA ligase''' is a specific type of enzyme, a [[ligase]], ({{EC number|6.5.1.1}}) that repairs single-stranded discontinuities in double stranded [[DNA]] molecules, in simple words strands that have double-strand break (a break in both complementary strands of DNA). Purified DNA ligase is used in gene cloning to join DNA molecules together. The alternative, a single-strand break, is fixed by a different type of DNA ligase using the [[Complementary DNA|complementary strand]] as a template,&lt;ref name=pmid15565146&gt;{{cite journal |pages=473–8 |doi=10.1038/nature03082 |title=Human DNA ligase I completely encircles and partially unwinds nicked DNA |year=2004 |last1=Pascal |first1=John M. |last2=O'Brien |first2=Patrick J. |last3=Tomkinson |first3=Alan E. |last4=Ellenberger |first4=Tom |journal=Nature |volume=432 |issue=7016 |pmid=15565146}}&lt;/ref&gt; but still requires DNA ligase to create the final [[phosphodiester bond]] to fully repair the DNA.

DNA ligase has applications in both [[DNA repair]] and [[DNA replication]] (see [[DNA ligase#Mammalian ligases|''Mammalian ligases'']]).  In addition, DNA ligase has extensive use in molecular biology laboratories for [[Genetic recombination]] experiments (see [[DNA ligase#Applications in molecular biology research|''Applications in molecular biology research'']]).

==Ligase mechanism==
The mechanism of DNA ligase is to form two [[covalent]] [[phosphodiester bonds]] between [[3' end|3' hydroxyl ends]] of one [[nucleotide]], (&quot;acceptor&quot;) with the [[5' end|5' phosphate end]] of another (&quot;donor&quot;). ATP is required for the ligase reaction, which proceeds in three steps: (1) adenylation (addition of AMP) of a residue in the active center of the enzyme, [[pyrophosphate]] is released; (2) transfer of the AMP to the 5' phosphate of the so-called donor, formation of a pyrophosphate bond; (3) formation of a phosphodiester bond between the 5' phosphate of the donor and the 3' hydroxyl of the acceptor.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid4377758&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pages=790–7 |doi=10.1126/science.186.4166.790 |title=DNA Ligase: Structure, Mechanism, and Function |year=1974 |last1=Lehnman |first1=I. R. |journal=Science |volume=186 |issue=4166 |pmid=4377758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ligation.svg|thumb|none|upright=2|A pictorial example of how a ligase works (with [[DNA end|sticky end]]s)]]

Ligase will also work with [[DNA end|blunt end]]s, although higher enzyme concentrations and different reaction conditions are required.

==Mammalian ligases== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[DNA ligase]] --&gt;
In mammals, there are four specific types of ligase.
*[[LIG1|DNA ligase I]]: ligates the nascent DNA of the [[Replication fork#Lagging strand|lagging strand]] after the Ribonuclease H has removed the RNA primer from the [[Okazaki fragment]]s.
*DNA ligase II: alternatively [[RNA splicing|splice]]d form of DNA ligase III found in non-dividing cells.
*DNA ligase III: [[protein complex|complexes]] with [[DNA repair]] [[protein]] [[XRCC1]] to aid in sealing DNA during the process of [[DNA repair|nucleotide excision repair]] and recombinant fragments.
*[[LIG4|DNA ligase IV]]: complexes with [[XRCC4]].  It catalyzes the final step in the [[non-homologous end joining]] DNA double-strand break repair pathway.  It is also required for [[V(D)J recombination]], the process that generates diversity in [[immunoglobulin]] and [[T-cell receptor]] loci during [[immune system]] development.
Some forms of DNA ligase present in bacteria (usually larger) may require NAD to act as a co-factor, whereas other forms of DNA ligases (usually present in ''E.coli'', and usually smaller) may require ATP to react. Also, a number of other structures present in the DNA ligase are the AMP and lysine, both of which are important in the ligation process since they create an intermediate enzyme.

==Applications in molecular biology research==
DNA ligases have become an indispensable tool in modern molecular biology research for generating [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] DNA sequences.  For example, DNA ligases are used with [[restriction enzyme]]s to insert DNA fragments, often [[genes]], into [[plasmid]]s.

One vital aspect to performing efficient recombination experiments involving the ligation of cohesive-ended fragments is controlling the optimal temperature.  Most experiments use T4 DNA Ligase (isolated from [[Enterobacteria phage T4|bacteriophage T4]]), which is most active at 25°C.  However, for optimal ligation efficiency with cohesive-ended fragments (&quot;sticky ends&quot;), the optimal enzyme temperature needs to be balanced with the [[melting temperature]] T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; (also the [[annealing temperature]]) of the sticky ends being ligated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Current Protocols&quot;&gt;Tabor, Stanley.  DNA ligases.  Chapter in:  Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Book 1.  2001: Wiley Interscience.{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the ambient temperature exceeds T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Homologous chromosome|homologous pairing]] of the sticky ends would not be stable because the high temperature disrupts [[hydrogen bonding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/20325 Law-breaking liquid defies the rules] at physicsworld.com&lt;/ref&gt; Ligation reaction is most efficient when the sticky ends are already stably annealed, disruption of the annealing ends would therefore results in low ligation efficiency. The shorter the [[DNA end#Overhangs and sticky ends|overhang]], the lower the T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, typically a 4-base overhang has a T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of 12-16°C.  

Since blunt-ended DNA fragments have no cohesive ends to anneal, the melting temperature is not a factor to consider within the normal temperature range of the ligation reaction.  However, the higher the temperature, the less chance that the ends to be joined will be aligned to allow ligation (molecules move around the solution more at higher temperatures).  The limiting factor in blunt end ligation is not the activity of the ligase but rather the number of alignments between DNA fragment ends that occur.  The most efficient ligation temperature for blunt-ended DNA would therefore be the temperature at which the greatest number of alignments can occur.  Therefore, the majority of blunt-ended ligations are carried out at 14-20°C overnight.  The absence of a stably annealed ends also means that the ligation efficiency is lowered, requiring a higher ligase concentration to be used.(T4 DNA ligase is the only commercially-available DNA ligase to anneal blunt ends).&lt;ref name=&quot;Current Protocols&quot;/&gt;

==History==
The first DNA ligase was purified and characterized in 1967. The common commercially available DNA ligases were originally discovered in [[Enterobacteria phage T4|bacteriophage T4]], ''[[E. coli]]'' and other [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WeissRichardson1967&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1021–8 |doi=10.1073/pnas.57.4.1021 |title=Enzymatic Breakage and Joining of Deoxyribonucleic Acid, I.

'''Z-DNA''' is one of the many possible double helical structures of [[DNA]]. It is a left-handed double helical structure in which the double helix winds to the left in a zig-zag pattern (instead of to the right, like the more common [[B-DNA]] form). Z-DNA is thought to be one of three biologically active double helical structures along with [[A-DNA|A-]] and B-DNA.

==History==
Z-DNA was the first single-crystal X-ray structure of a DNA fragment (a self-complementary DNA hexamer d(CG)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). It was resolved as a left-handed double helix with two anti-parallel chains that were held together by Watson-Crick base pairs (see: [[x-ray crystallography]]). It was solved by Andrew Wang, [[Alexander Rich]], and co-workers in 1979 at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref name=Wang1979&gt;{{cite journal

In 2007, the [[RNA]] version of Z-DNA, [[Z-RNA]], was described as a transformed version of an [[A-RNA]] double helix into a left-handed helix.&lt;ref name=&quot;Placido2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Structure==
[[Image:B-, Z-DNA junction 2ACJ.png|right|thumb|B-/Z-DNA junction bound to a Z-DNA binding domain. Note the two highlighted extruded bases. From {{PDB|2ACJ}}.]]
Z-DNA is quite different from the right-handed forms. In fact, Z-DNA is often compared against B-DNA in order to illustrate the major differences. The Z-DNA helix is left-handed and has a structure that repeats every 2 base pairs. The major and minor grooves, unlike A- and B-DNA, show little difference in width. Formation of this structure is generally unfavourable, although certain conditions can promote it; such as alternating [[purine]]-[[pyrimidine]] sequence (especially poly(dGC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), negative [[DNA supercoil]]ing or high salt and some [[cation]]s (all at physiological temperature, 37°C, and pH 7.3-7.4). Z-DNA can form a junction with B-DNA (called a &quot;B-to-Z junction box&quot;) in a structure which involves the extrusion of a base pair.&lt;ref name=&quot;deRosaM2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The Z-DNA conformation has been difficult to study because it does not exist as a stable feature of the double helix. Instead, it is a transient structure that is occasionally induced by biological activity and then quickly disappears.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZhangH2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===Predicting Z-DNA structure===
It is possible to predict the likelihood of a DNA sequence forming a Z-DNA structure. An algorithm for predicting the propensity of DNA to flip from the B-form to the Z-form, ''ZHunt'', was written by Dr. [[P. Shing Ho]] in 1984 (at MIT).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3780676&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ho PS, Ellison MJ, Quigley GJ, Rich A |title=A computer aided thermodynamic approach for predicting the formation of Z-DNA in naturally occurring sequences |journal=EMBO Journal |year=1986 |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=2737–2744 |pmid=3780676 |pmc=1167176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This algorithm was later developed by [[Tracy Camp]], [[P. Christoph Champ]], [[Sandor Maurice]], and [[Jeffrey M. Vargason]] for genome-wide mapping of Z-DNA (with P. Shing Ho as the principal investigator).&lt;ref name=Champ2004&gt;{{cite journal

==Biological significance==
While no definitive biological significance of Z-DNA has been found, it is commonly believed to provide torsional strain relief ([[DNA supercoiling|supercoiling]]) while DNA transcription occurs.&lt;ref name=Ha2005&gt;{{cite journal

In 2003, Biophysicist Alexander Rich of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology noticed that a poxvirus virulence factor, called E3L that has a Z-alpha related domain, mimicked a mammalian protein that binds Z-DNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kim2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

|pmc=341766
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Rich and his colleagues pinned down what E3L does for the poxvirus. When expressed in human cells, E3L increases by five- to 10-fold the production of several genes that block a cell’s ability to self-destruct in response to infection.

Rich speculates that the Z-DNA is necessary for transcription and that E3L stabilizes the Z-DNA, thus prolonging expression of the anti-apoptotic genes. He suggests that a small molecule that interferes with the E3L binding to Z-DNA could thwart the activation of these genes and help protect people from pox infections.

'''Ancient DNA''' is [[DNA]] isolated from ancient [[specimen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics By Jonathan Pevsner ISBN 9780470085851 0470085851&lt;/ref&gt; It can be also loosely described as any [[DNA]] recovered from biological samples that have not been preserved specifically for later DNA analyses. Examples include the analysis of [[DNA]] recovered from archaeological and historical skeletal material, [[Mummy|mummified]] tissues, archival collections of non-frozen medical specimens, preserved plant remains, ice and [[permafrost]] cores, Holocene plankton in marine and lake sediments, and so on. Unlike modern genetic analyses, ancient DNA studies are characterised by low quality [[DNA]]. This places limits on what analyses can achieve. Furthermore, due to degradation of the DNA molecules, a process which correlates loosely with factors such as time, temperature and presence of free water, upper limits exist beyond which no DNA is deemed likely to survive. Current estimates suggest that in optimal environments, i.e. environments which are very cold, such as permafrost or ice, an upper limit of around 1 million years exists. As such, early studies that reported recovery of much older [[DNA]], for example from [[Cretaceous]] [[dinosaur]] remains, may have stemmed from contamination of the sample. 

==History of Ancient DNA studies==
Arguably the first aDNA study was in 1984, with a publication by Russ Higuchi and colleagues at Berkeley that was to revolutionise the scope of [[molecular biology]], traces of DNA from a museum specimen of the [[Quagga]], not only remained in the specimen over 150 years after the death of the individual, but could be extracted and sequenced.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6504142&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Higuchi R, Bowman B, Freiberger M, Ryder OA, Wilson AC |title=DNA sequences from the quagga, an extinct member of the horse family |journal=Nature |volume=312 |issue=5991 |pages=282–4 |year=1984 |pmid=6504142 |doi= 10.1038/312282a0|url=|bibcode = 1984Natur.312..282H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years, through investigations into natural and artificially mummified specimens, [[Svante Pääbo]] both confirmed that this phenomenon was not limited to relatively recent museum specimens, but could apparently be replicated in a range of [[Mummy|mummified]] [[human]] samples that dated as far back as several thousand years ([[Svante Pääbo|Pääbo]] 1985a; [[Svante Pääbo|Pääbo]] 1985b; [[Svante Pääbo|Pääbo]]1986).
Nevertheless, the laborious processes that were required at that time to sequence such DNA (through [[bacterial cloning]]) were an effective brake on the development of the field of ancient DNA (aDNA). However, with the development of the [[Polymerase chain reaction|Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR) in the late 1980s the field was presented with the ability to rapidly progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3431465&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mullis KB, Faloona FA |title=Specific synthesis of DNA in vitro via a polymerase-catalyzed chain reaction |journal=Meth.

Double primers PCR amplification of aDNA (jumping-PCR) can produce highly-skewed and non-authentic sequence artifacts. Multiple primer, [[Nested polymerase chain reaction|nested PCR]] strategy was used to overcome those shortcomings. 

Single primer extension (abr. SPEX) amplification was introduced in 2007 to address post mortem DNA modification damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Problems and errors==
aDNA may contain a large number of postmortem [[mutation]]s, increasing with time. Some regions of polynucleotide are more susceptible to this degradation so sequence data can bypass statistical filters used to check the validity of data.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.454genomics.net/downloads/news-events/geneticanalysisfromancientdna.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Due to sequencing errors, great caution should be applied to interpretation of population size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Antediluvian DNA studies==
{{Out of date|date=November 2010}}
The post-PCR era heralded a wave of publications as numerous research groups tried their hands at aDNA. Soon a series of incredible findings had been published, claiming authentic DNA could be extracted from specimens that were millions of years old, into the realms of what Lindahl (1993b) has labelled [[Antediluvian]] DNA. The majority of such claims were based on the retrieval of DNA from organisms preserved in [[amber]]. Insects such as stingless bees (Cano ''et al.'' 1992a; Cano ''et al.'' 1992b), termites (De Salle ''et al.'' 1992; De Salle ''et al.'' 1993) and wood gnats (De Salle and Grimaldi 1994), as well as plant ([[Hendrik Poinar|Poinar]] ''et al.'' 1993) and bacterial (Cano ''et al.'' 1994) sequences were extracted from [[Dominica]]n amber dating to the [[Oligocene]] epoch. Still older sources of Lebanese amber-encased [[weevil]]s, dating to within the Cretaceous epoch, reportedly also yielded authentic DNA (Cano ''et al.'' 1993). DNA retrieval was also not limited to amber. Several sediment-preserved plant remains dating to the [[Miocene]] were successfully investigated (Golenberg ''et al.'' 1990; Golenberg 1991). Then, in 1994 and to international acclaim, Woodward ''et al.'' reported the most exciting results to date&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7973705&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woodward SR, Weyand NJ, Bunnell M |title=DNA sequence from Cretaceous period bone fragments |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5188 |pages=1229–32 |year=1994 |month=November |pmid=7973705 |doi= 10.1126/science.7973705|url=|bibcode = 1994Sci...266.1229W }}&lt;/ref&gt; -mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences that had apparently been extracted from dinosaur bones dating to over 80 million years ago. When in 1995 two further studies reported dinosaur DNA sequences extracted from a Cretaceous egg (An ''et al.'' 1995; Li ''et al.'' 1995) it seemed that the field would truly revolutionise knowledge of the Earth’s evolutionary past. 
Unfortunately the golden days of aDNA did not last.

==Ancient DNA studies on human remains==
Due to the considerable [[anthropology|anthropological]], [[archaeology|archaeological]], and [[public interest]] directed towards human remains, it is only natural that they have received a similar amount of attention from the DNA community. Due to their obvious signs of [[comparative anatomy|morphological]] preservation, many studies utilised mummified tissue as a source of ancient human DNA. Examples include both naturally preserved specimens, for example those preserved in ice, such as the [[Ötzi the Iceman]] (Handt ''et al.'' 1994), or through rapid [[desiccation]], for example high-altitude mummies from the Andes (c.f. [[Svante Pääbo|Pääbo]] 1986; Montiel ''et al.'' 2001)), as well as various sources of artificially preserved tissue (such as the chemically treated mummies of ancient Egypt).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7806242&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hänni C, Laudet V, Coll J, Stehelin D |title=An unusual mitochondrial DNA sequence variant from an Egyptian mummy |journal=Genomics |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=487–9 |year=1994 |month=July |pmid=7806242 |doi=10.1006/geno.1994.1417 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mummified remains are a limited resource, and the majority of human aDNA studies have focused on extracting DNA from two sources that are much more common in the [[archaeological record]] – [[bone]] and [[Tooth|teeth]]. Recently, several other sources have also yielded DNA, including [[coprolite|paleofaeces]] ([[Hendrik Poinar|Poinar]] ''et al.'' 2001) and [[hair]] (Baker ''et al.'' 2001, Gilbert ''et al.'' 2004). Contamination remains a major problem when working on ancient human material.

===Pathogen and microorganism a DNA analyses using human remains===
The use of degraded human samples in aDNA analyses has not been limited to the amplification of human DNA. It is reasonable to assume that for a period of time post mortem, DNA may survive from any microorganisms present in the specimen at death. This not only includes pathogens present at the time of death (either the cause of death or long-term infections) but commensals and other associated microbes. Despite several studies that have reported limited preservation of such DNA, for example the lack of preservation of [[Helicobacter pylori]] in ethanol-preserved specimens dating to the 18th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11113876&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barnes I, Holton J, Vaira D, Spigelman M, Thomas MG |title=An assessment of the long-term preservation of the DNA of a bacterial pathogen in ethanol-preserved archival material |journal=J.

As well as the usual sources of mummified tissue, bones and teeth, such studies have also examined a range of other tissue samples, including calcified [[Pleural cavity|pleura]] (Donoghue ''et al.'' 1998), tissue embedded in [[paraffin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9448313&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jackson PJ |title=PCR analysis of tissue samples from the 1979 Sverdlovsk anthrax victims: The presence of multiple Bacillus anthracis strains in different victims |journal=Proc.

'''''Daily News and Analysis''''' ('''''DNA''''') is an Indian [[Broadsheet (newspaper format)|Broadsheet]] published in the English language from [[Mumbai]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Pune]], [[Jaipur]], [[Bangalore]] and [[Indore]] in [[India]]. It was Launched in July 2005, targeted at a young readership.

DNA is owned and managed by Diligent Media Corporation, a joint venture between the [[D B Corp Ltd.]] ([[Dainik Bhaskar]]) and [[Essel Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;indiantelevision&quot; /&gt;

==Launch==
A high-profile advertisement campaign with the tagline &quot;Speak up, it’s in your DNA&quot; preceded the birth of ''Daily News and Analysis'' in 2005, The newspaper competition around the time of the launch of DNA was fierce, with price cuts, hiring of staff from rival newspapers, and other competitive activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050821/asp/opinion/story_5138679.asp | title = Mumbai’s battle will quickly spill over to New Delhi | date = 2005-08-21 | publisher = The Telegraph - Calcutta | author = Debashis Bhattacharyya }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;indiantelevision&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k5/june/june115.htm | title = 'DNA' gears up for a price war | author = Indiantelevision.com Team | date = 2005-06-10 | publisher = Indiantelevision.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an announcement on the front page of DNA on February 1, 2010, Aditya Sinha, Editor-in-Chief, DNA, stated that DNA will drop it's edit page from the newspaper, hence making a benchmark in the newspaper's history. This was a very bold move taken by Mr. Aditya Sinha, which attracted much criticism in the journalism field. Instead DNA started  providing expert opinion &amp; comments in different pages of the newspaper wherever it is needed.

==Format==
DNA is the first english broadsheet daily in India to introduce an all-colour page format.

The paper is broken up into sections. The main section includes an interactive Speak Up page, and City, Nation and World news pages. There is also an editorial page, and a technology page (IKnow). The other sections include Money, Sports and After Hours. DNA Money is a section on business and the economy. After Hours is a 10-page section with news from [[Bollywood]], art and fashion, and other such topics.&lt;ref name=&quot;dance-review&quot; &gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dancewithshadows.com/media/dna-newspaper-mumbai-review.asp | publisher = Dance with Shadows | date = 2005-08-01 | title = DNA NEWSPAPER - REVIEW }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mumbai edition features three region-specific supplements for Thane, West Coast and [[Navi Mumbai]]. Two magazines — a women's magazine called ''Me'' and a children's magazine called ''YA! Young Adults'' — complete the repertoire.

==Circulation==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Just 5.png|thumb|300px|]] --&gt;
In October 2011, as per the MRUC's (Media Research Users Council)Indian Readership Survey (IRS) Round II determined DNA’s total readership to be 12.42 lakh in Mumbai and an average issue readership (AIR), across its six editions, of 8.24 lakh. IRS also ranked DNA as no. 6th among the Top Ten English Dailies in India. DNA is the second most read English broadsheet in the city of Mumbai.


The country’s youngest English newspaper continues to set a scorching pace, registering 86% growth in AIR over the five years since the IRS survey in the second half of 2006, nearly doubling the issue readership from 4.44 lakh.
DNA also has the highest percentage of readers (36.3%) in the 30-49 age group in Mumbai among the English dailies, and the second highest percentage of readers who are graduates (52.2%) or fall in the socio-economic classes A and B (73.5%).


On February 11, 2007, DNA announced that its paid circulation had reached 400,000 in Mumbai. It had previously reached 300,000 in October 2006. In May 2006, DNA authorized Ernst &amp; Young to certify its circulation figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chronosphere.biz/IMO/26/imo.html#dna | title = DNA commissions E&amp;Y to certify circulation | work = Indian Media Observer (issue #26) | author = Bhupesh Trivedi | date = 2006-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; E &amp; Y submitted its report in July, putting its paid circulation at 270,000.

== Editions ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:No Paid News.png|thumb|300px]] --&gt;
DNA is currently published from Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune, Ahmedabad,Jaipur and Indore. DNA has stopped publishing from Surat.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

DNA provides a supplement called &quot;YA! Young Adults&quot; in Mumbai and parts of Pune.  It is mainly targeted toward children from 4 to 18 years old, but it is also read by many parents and older people.  It is published by editor Lubaina Badukwala and is delivered to children (subscribers or non-subscribers) on every Sunday.

The supplement typically contains information about happenings around Mumbai, contests, games and puzzles, comics, jokes, recipes, as well as coverage of international issues such as global warming and ill-treatment of animals, children's problems like bullying and heavy homework, various facts and news, and children's contributions such as poems, essays, articles on their life, letters to the editor, and drawings.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4321">'''DNA isolation''' is a routine procedure to collect [[DNA]] for subsequent [[molecular biology|molecular]] or [[forensics|forensic]] analysis. There are three basic and two optional steps in a DNA extraction:

# Breaking the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] open, commonly referred to as [[cell disruption]] or [[cell lysis]], to expose the DNA within. This is commonly achieved by chemical and physical methods-blending, grinding or [[sonication|sonicating]] the sample.
# Removing membrane lipids by adding a [[detergent]] or [[surfactants]].
# Removing [[protein]]s by adding a [[protease]] (optional but almost always done).
# Removing [[RNA]] by adding an [[RNase]] (often done).
# Precipitating the DNA with an alcohol &amp;mdash; usually ice-cold [[ethanol]] or [[isopropanol]]. Since DNA is insoluble in these alcohols, it will aggregate together, giving a ''pellet'' upon centrifugation. This step also removes alcohol-soluble salt.

Refinements of the technique include adding a [[chelating agent]] to sequester divalent cations such as [[magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[calcium|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]], which prevents enzymes like [[DNase]] from degrading the DNA.

Cellular and [[histone]] proteins bound to the DNA can be removed either by adding a [[protease]] or by having precipitated the proteins with [[sodium acetate|sodium]] or [[ammonium acetate]], or [[phenol-chloroform extraction|extracted them with a phenol-chloroform]] mixture prior to the DNA-precipitation.

If desired, the DNA can be resolubilized in a slightly alkaline buffer or in ultra-pure water.

==Special Types of DNA Extractions==
A Hirt DNA Extraction is an isolation of all [[extrachromosomal DNA]] in a mammalian cell. The Hirt extraction process gets rid of the high molecular weight [[nuclear DNA]], leaving only low molecular weight [[mitochondrial DNA]] and any viral [[episomes]] present in the cell.

==Detecting DNA==
{{main|Quantification of nucleic acids}}

A diphenylamine (DPA) indicator will confirm the presence of DNA. This procedure involves chemical hydrolysis of DNA: when heated (e.g. ≥95&amp;nbsp;°C) in acid, the reaction requires a deoxyribose sugar and therefore is specific for DNA. Under these conditions, the 2-deoxyribose is converted to w-hydroxylevulinyl aldehyde, which reacts with the compound, diphenylamine, to produce a blue-colored compound. DNA concentration can be determined measuring the intensity of absorbance of the solution at the 600 nm with a [[spectrophotometer]] and comparing to a [[standard curve]] of known DNA concentrations. 

Measuring the intensity of absorbance of the DNA solution at wavelengths [[Quantification of nucleic acids|260 nm and 280 nm]] is used as a measure of DNA purity. DNA absorbs [[UV]] light at 260 and 280 nanometres, and aromatic proteins absorb UV light at 280 nm; a pure sample of DNA has the 260/280 ratio at 1.8 and is relatively free from protein contamination. A DNA preparation that is contaminated with protein will have a 260/280 ratio lower than 1.8.

DNA can be quantified by cutting the DNA with a [[restriction enzyme]], running it on an agarose [[gel electrophoresis|gel]], staining with [[ethidium bromide]] or a different stain and comparing the intensity of the DNA with a DNA marker of known concentration.  

Using the [[Southern blot]] technique, this quantified DNA can be isolated and examined further using [[PCR]] and [[RFLP]] analysis. These procedures allow differentiation of the repeated sequences within the genome. It is these techniques which [[forensic]] scientists use for comparison, identification, and analysis.
