'''Hollywood''' is a district in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]] situated west-northwest of [[downtown Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laalmanac.com/LA/lamap2.htm City of Los Angeles Map – Larger View]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its fame and [[cultural identity]] as the historical center of [[movie studio]]s and movie stars, the word ''Hollywood'' is often used as a [[metonymy|metonym]] of [[cinema of the United States|American cinema]]. Today, much of the movie industry has dispersed into surrounding areas such as the [[Los Angeles Westside|Westside]] neighborhood,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muniservices.com/consulting/LA_Final%20Evaluation%20Report%20January%2015.pdf Final Evaluation]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; and the  [[San Fernando Valley|San Fernando]] and [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]] Valleys, but significant auxiliary industries, such as [[Film Editing|editing]], [[Special Effects|effects]], [[Theatrical property|props]], [[post-production]], and [[lighting]] companies remain in Hollywood, as does the [[backlot]] of [[Paramount Pictures]].

On February&amp;nbsp;16, 2005, [[California Assembly]] Members [[Jackie Goldberg]] and [[Paul Koretz]] introduced a bill to require California to keep specific records on Hollywood as if it were independent, although it is not the typical practice of the City of Los Angeles to establish specific boundaries for districts or neighborhoods. For this to be done, the boundaries were defined. The bill was unanimously supported by the Hollywood [[Chamber of Commerce]] and the [[Los Angeles City Council]]. Assembly Bill 588 was approved by the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|Governor of California]] on August&amp;nbsp;28, 2006, and now the district of Hollywood has official borders. The border can be loosely described as the area east of [[West Hollywood]], south of [[Mulholland Drive]], [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Laurel Canyon]], [[Cahuenga Boulevard]], and Barham Boulevard, and the cities of [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], north of [[Melrose Avenue]] and west of the [[Golden State Freeway]] and Hyperion Avenue. This includes all of [[Griffith Park]] and [[Los Feliz]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} – two areas that were hitherto considered separate from Hollywood by most [[Angelenos]].{{Who|date=July 2010}} The population of the district, including Los Feliz, as of the 2000 census was 123,436 and the [[median]] household income was $33,409 in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Almanac&quot;/&gt;

As a district within the Los Angeles city limits, Hollywood does not have its own municipal government. There was an official, appointed by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, who served as an honorary &quot;[[Mayor of Hollywood]]&quot; for ceremonial purposes only. [[Johnny Grant (radio personality)|Johnny Grant]] held this position from 1980 until his death on January&amp;nbsp;9, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/10/grant.obit|title=Johnny Grant, honorary Hollywood mayor, dies|publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 12, 2008 | date=January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no replacement has ever been named after Grant's death.

==History==
In 1853, one [[adobe]] hut stood in Nopalera, named for the Mexican ''nopal'' [[cactus]] indigenous to the area. By 1870, an agricultural community flourished in the area with thriving crops of many common and exotic varieties. The area was known to these residents as the [[Cahuenga Pass|Cahuenga Valley]], after the pass in the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] immediately to the north. Soon thereafter, land speculation led to subdivision of the large plots and an influx of homeowners.

In spite of the area's short history, it has been filled with events driven by optimistic progress. The name Hollywood was coined by [[Hobart Johnstone Whitley|H. J. Whitley]], the &quot;Father of Hollywood&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Thefatherofhollywood&quot;&gt;California Historian Volume 54, Number 4 published by Conference of California Historical Societies (2008) [http://www.californiahistorian.com/magazine.html California Historian Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Whitley's Hollywood&quot;&gt;FOX 40 News(2011)[http://www.fox40.com/videobeta/0965a0bd-9cf2-4ce3-87fe-0aa7ea0b5c4e/News/Father-Hollywood Father Hollywood – KTXL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;The Great Developer&quot;&gt;Jonathan Magazine http://www.thefatherofhollywood.com/Jonathans.pdf (March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Rivers in the Desert&quot;&gt;Margaret Leslie Davis, [http://books.google.com/books?id=7lvRnuwxmUoC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=h+j+whitley&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4P5-TOT3Koa4sAO7yeX0Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=h%20j%20whitley&amp;f=false Rivers in the Desert] (1993), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;hollywoodbritannica&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1476285/H-J-Whitley(1993) Hollywood – Britannica retrieved 9-3-2010] Real-estate magnate H.J.

J. WHITLEY]. Retrieved July 17, 2008. &quot;H. J. Whitley, pioneer California real estate man and known as the &quot;Father of Hollywood&quot; died yesterday at the age of 83 years and after an illness of more than a year. Mr. Whitley died during his sleep while staying as a guest of his son Ross Whitley at the Whitley Park&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Whitley arranged to buy the {{convert|500|acre|km2|adj=on}} E.C. Hurd ranch and disclosed to him his plans for the land. They agreed on a price and Hurd agreed to sell at a later date. Before Whitley got off the ground with Hollywood, plans for the new town had spread to General [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]], Mr Hurd's wife, [[Daeida Wilcox Beveridge|Mrs. Daeida Wilcox]], and numerous others through the mill of gossip and land speculation.

Daeida learned of the name Hollywood from her neighbor in Holly Canyon (now Lake Hollywood), Ivar Weid, a prominent investor and friend of Whitley's.&lt;ref name = &quot;TheFatherofHollywood&quot;&gt;The Father of Hollywood by Gaelyn Whitley Keith (2010) pg. 127pg http://www.thefatherofhollywood.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Ivar Weid&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=WCMLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA93&amp;lpg=RA4-PA93&amp;dq=hj+whitley&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ApmqanZhUR&amp;sig=8AP2QOBYncpkFb2u8HgpMBrdpes#v=onepage&amp;q=hj%20whitley&amp;f=false The Quarterly], pg 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; She recommended the same name to her husband, H. H. Wilcox. On February&amp;nbsp;1, 1887, Harvey filed a deed and map of property he sold with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office. Harvey wanted to be the first to record it on a deed. The early real-estate boom busted that same year, yet Hollywood began its slow growth.

By 1900, the region had a post office, newspaper, hotel, and two markets. Los Angeles, with a population of 102,479&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-07.pdf No. HS-7. Population of the Largest 75 Cities: 1900 to 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; lay {{convert|10|mi|km}} east through the [[vineyards]], barley fields, and [[citrus]] groves. A single-track [[streetcar line]] ran down the middle of Prospect Avenue from it, but service was infrequent and the trip took two hours. The old citrus fruit-packing house would be converted into a livery [[stable]], improving transportation for the inhabitants of Hollywood.

The famous [[Hollywood Hotel]], the first major hotel in Hollywood, was opened in 1902, by [[Hobart Johnstone Whitley|H.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;Whitley]], then President of the Los Pacific Boulevard and Development Company, of which he was a major shareholder. Having finally acquired the Hurd ranch and subdivided&amp;nbsp;it, Whitley built the hotel to attract land buyers, and was eager to sell these residential lots among the lemon ranches lining the foothills. Flanking the west side of [[Highland Avenue]], the structure fronted on [[Prospect Avenue]], which, still a dusty, unpaved road, was regularly graded and graveled. The Hotel was to become internationally known and was the center of the civic and social life and home of the stars for many years.&lt;ref name = &quot;Historic Hotel and New Shops Drawing Cards&quot;&gt;[http://www.thefatherofhollywood.com/TheFatherofHollywoodDiesHollywoodDailyCitizen.pdf Hollywood Daily Citizen (1931)]&lt;/ref&gt; His company was developing and selling one of the early residential areas, the Ocean View Tract.&lt;ref name = &quot;H.

He paid many thousands of dollars for electric lighting, including bringing electricity and building a bank, as well as a road into the [[Cahuenga Pass]]. The lighting ran for several blocks down Prospect Avenue. Whitley's land was centered on [[Highland Avenue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A Dream Picture&quot;&gt;Cahuenga Valley Sentinel (May 7, 1904).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Why I live in Hollywood by H. J.

Hollywood was incorporated as a [[municipality]] on November&amp;nbsp;14, 1903. The vote was 88 for incorporation and 77 against. On January&amp;nbsp;30, 1904, the voters in Hollywood decided, by a vote of 113 to&amp;nbsp;96, for the banishment of liquor in the city, except when it was being sold for medicinal purposes. Neither hotels nor restaurants were allowed to serve wine or liquor before or after meals.

By 1910, because of an ongoing struggle to secure an adequate water supply, town officials voted for Hollywood to be [[annexed]] into the City of Los Angeles, as the water system of the growing city had opened the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] and was piping water down from the [[Owens River]] in the [[Owens Valley]]. Another reason for the vote was that Hollywood could have access to drainage through Los Angeles' sewer system. With annexation, the name of Prospect Avenue was changed to Hollywood [[Boulevard]] and all the street numbers in the new district changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abouthollywood.com/hollywood-neighborhoods/hollywood-california-history-and-information/ Hollywood California | Hollywood History and Information]. Abouthollywood.com (2010-11-16). Retrieved on 2011-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 100&amp;nbsp;Prospect Avenue, at [[Vermont]] Avenue, became 6400 Hollywood Boulevard; and 100&amp;nbsp;Cahuenga Boulevard, at Hollywood Boulevard, changed to 1700 Cahuenga Boulevard.

===Motion picture industry===
{{Main|Cinema of the United States}}
Filmmaking in the greater Los Angeles area preceded the establishment of filmmaking in Hollywood. The [[American Mutoscope and Biograph|Biograph Company]] filmed the short film ''A Daring Hold-Up in Southern California'' in Los Angeles in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Niver (1971), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The first studio in the Los Angeles area was established by the [[Selig Polyscope Company]] in [[Edendale, Los Angeles, California|Edendale]], with construction beginning in August 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (2001), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolific director [[D. W. Griffith]] was the first to make a motion picture in Hollywood. His 17-minute short film ''[[In Old California (1910 film)|In&amp;nbsp;Old California]]'', which was released on March 10, 1910, was filmed entirely in the village of Hollywood for the [[Biograph Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/feb/28/philip-french-best-hollywood-films |title=How 100 years of Hollywood have charted the history of America |accessdate=May 24, 2010 |author=Philip French |date=February 28, 2010|work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=L.A.

Various producers and filmmakers moved bases from the east coast to escape punitive licensing from the [[Motion Picture Patents Company]].

The first studio in Hollywood was established by the New Jersey–based Centaur Co., which wanted to make westerns in California. They rented an unused [[roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]] at 6121 [[Sunset Boulevard]] at the corner of [[Gower Street (Hollywood)|Gower]], and converted it into a movie studio in October 1911, calling it Nestor Studio after the name of the western branch of their company.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson (2001), p. 21. The facility later became the Hollywood Film Laboratory, which is now called the Hollywood Digital Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt; The first feature film made specifically in a Hollywood studio, in 1914, was ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'', directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and [[Oscar Apfel]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Feature film|Feature-length]] films made in the Los Angeles area before ''The Squaw Man'' include ''From Dusk to Dawn'' (1913) and ''The Sea Wolf'' (1913). ''American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was filmed at the [[Lasky-DeMille Barn]] among other area locations.

By 1911, Los Angeles was second only to New York in motion picture production,&lt;ref&gt;Eileen Bowser, ''The Transformation of Cinema, 1907–1915'', University of California Press, 1990, p. 160. ISBN 978-0-520-08534-3.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1915, the majority of American films were being produced in the Los Angeles area.&lt;ref&gt;Koszarski (1994), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Hollywood-Studios-1922.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Hollywood movie studios, 1922]]
Four major film companies – [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] and [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] – had studios in Hollywood, as did several minor companies and rental studios. Hollywood had begun its dramatic transformation from sleepy suburb to movie production capital. The residential and agrarian [[Hollywood Boulevard]] of 1910 was virtually unrecognizable by 1920 as the new commercial and retail sector replaced it. The sleepy town was no more, and, to the chagrin of many original residents, the boom town could not be stopped.

===1920s–1940s===
By 1920, Hollywood had become world-famous as the center of the [[Cinema of the United States|United States film industry]]. In 1918, HJ&amp;nbsp;Whitley commissioned architect A.S. Barnes to design Whitley Heights as a Mediterranean-style village on the steep hillsides above Hollywood Boulevard, and it became the first celebrity community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neighborly Advice: Whitley Heights&quot;&gt;[http://www.whitleyheights.org/about8.html Whitley Heights] Los Angeles Times 1-13-2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mr. Whitley's Neighborhood&quot;&gt;Angeles by Laurie Connor http://www.whitleyheights.org/about5.html&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood is roughly bordered on the north and east by Cahuenga Boulevard, on the west by Highland Avenue, and on the south by [[Franklin Avenue (Los Angeles)|Franklin Avenue]]. Among [[Whitley Heights]]' many famous residents have been [[Rudolph Valentino]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], [[W.C.&amp;nbsp;Fields]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Carole Lombard]], [[William Powell]]. [[Tyrone Power]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Marlene Dietrich]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HPOZ Whitley Heights&quot;&gt;Office of Historic Resources http://www.preservation.lacity.org/hpoz/la/whitley-heights&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitley Heights pg. 34&quot;&gt;Discover Hollywood Magazine (Spring 2010) http://www.whitleyheights.org/about9.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitley Heights1992&quot;&gt;L A Conservancy http://www.laconservancy.org/initiatives/hpoz_WhitleyHts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neighborly Advice-Whitley Heights&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Times (January 13, 2009) http://www.whitleyheights.org/about8.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neighborly Advice-Whitley Heights&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Historic Neighborhood: Whitley Heights&quot;&gt;Architectural Digest (April 1996)http://www.whitleyheights.org/about1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Owensmouth Baby&quot;&gt;Owensmouth Baby by Catherine Mulholland (1987)http://www.thefatherofhollywood.com/TheOwensmouthBabybyCatherineMulholland.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;William Mulholland&quot;&gt;William Mulholland and the Rise of Los Angeles by Catherine Mulholland (2000)http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520234669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Who in Los Angeles County&quot;&gt;Who's Who in Los Angels County Pg. 334 (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Making of Hollywood&quot;&gt;The Making of Hollywood by Margaret Virginia Whitley (1930&lt;/ref&gt;  

From the 1920s to the 1940s, a large percentage of transportation to and from Hollywood was by means of the ''red cars'' of the [[Pacific Electric Railway]].

===Modern Hollywood===

On January 22, 1947, the first commercial television station west of the [[Mississippi River]], [[KTLA]], began operating in Hollywood. In December of that year, ''The Public Prosecutor'' became the first network television series to be filmed in Hollywood. In the 1950s, music recording studios and offices began moving into Hollywood. Other businesses, however, continued to migrate to different parts of the Los Angeles area, primarily to [[Burbank, California|Burbank]]. Much of the movie industry remained in Hollywood, although the district's outward appearance changed.

In 1952, [[CBS]] built [[CBS Television City]] on the corner of Fairfax Avenue and [[Beverly Boulevard]], on the former site of Gilmore Stadium. CBS's expansion into the [[Fairfax District (Los Angeles, California)|Fairfax District]] pushed the unofficial boundary of Hollywood farther south than it had been. CBS's slogan for the shows taped there was &quot;From Television City in Hollywood...&quot;

During the early 1950s the famous [[Hollywood Freeway]] was constructed from [[Four Level Interchange]] interchange in downtown Los Angeles, past the [[Hollywood Bowl]], up through [[Cahuenga Pass]] and into the [[San Fernando Valley]]. In the early days, streetcars ran up through the pass, on rails running along the central median.

The famous [[Capitol Records Building]] on [[Vine St.]] just north of Hollywood Boulevard was built in 1956. The building houses offices and recording studios, which are not open to the public, but its circular design looks like a stack of {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} vinyl records.

The now derelict lot at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Serrano Avenue was once the site of the illustrious [[Hollywood Professional School]], whose alumni reads like a Hollywood Who's Who of household &quot;names&quot;. Many of these former child stars attended a &quot;farewell&quot; party at the commemorative sealing of a time capsule buried on the lot.

The [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] was created in 1958 as a tribute to artists and other significant contributors within the entertainment industry. Official groundbreaking occurred on February&amp;nbsp;8, 1960, and the first star to be permanently installed was that of director [[Stanley Kramer]] (not [[Joanne Woodward]], as commonly related).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/index.php?page=10 History of WOF] ''hollywoodchamber.net''; Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. Retrieved May 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/446305052.html?dids=446305052:446305052&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar+29%2C+1960&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=KRAMER+FIRST+NAME+PUT+IN+WALK+OF+FAME&amp;pqatl=google &quot;Kramer First Name Put in Walk of Fame&quot;](abstract). ''Los Angeles Times'', March 29, 1960, p. 15. Full article: [https://secure.pqarchiver.com/latimes/display_pdf.pdf?filename=/share4/pqimage/hnirs103/20100609133722646/22322/out.pdf LA Times Archives]&lt;!-- PDF is behind a paywall--&gt; Retrieved June 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A&amp;nbsp;detailed history of the Walk can be found in the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Walk of Fame main article]]. Honorees receive a star based on their achievements in motion pictures, live theatre, [[radio programming|radio]], television, and/or music, as well as their charitable and civic contributions.

During the 1980s, Hollywood was the heart of a new [[Hard rock]] movement known as [[Glam metal]]. The most known Hollywood glam metal and hard rock bands include [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Poison (band)|Poison]], [[RATT]], [[W.A.S.P]], [[Quiet Riot]], [[Guns N' Roses]]  and [[Van Halen]]. These bands were notorious for their debauched and promiscuous lifestyle of late-night parties, drug and alcohol abuse, casual sex and backstage [[groupie]] antics. A haven for the pulsating music scene of the time, Hollywood also saw a number of popular bands from different genres emerge, such as [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Metallica]] and various others.

In 1985, the [[Hollywood Boulevard|Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District]] was officially listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] protecting important buildings and ensuring that the significance of Hollywood's past would always be a part of its future.

In June 1999, the Hollywood extension of the [[Los Angeles County Metro Rail]] [[LACMTA Red Line|Red Line]] [[rapid transit|subway]] opened, running from [[Downtown Los Angeles]] to the San Fernando Valley, with stops along Hollywood Boulevard at Western Avenue, Vine Street and Highland Avenue.

[[Image:HollywoodKodak.JPG|left|thumb|180px|The [[Kodak Theatre]]]]
The [[Kodak Theatre]], which opened in 2001 on Hollywood Boulevard at Highland Avenue, where the historic [[Hollywood Hotel]] once stood, has become the new home of the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]].

While motion picture production still occurs within the Hollywood district, most major studios are actually located elsewhere in the Los Angeles region. [[Paramount Pictures]] is the only major studio still physically located within Hollywood. Other studios in the district include the aforementioned Jim Henson (formerly Chaplin) Studios, Sunset Gower Studios, and Raleigh Studios.

While Hollywood and the adjacent neighborhood of [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]] served as the initial homes for all of the early television stations in the Los Angeles [[media market|market]], most have now relocated to other locations within the metropolitan area. [[KNBC]] began this exodus in 1962, when it moved from the former [[NBC Radio City Studios]] located at the northeast corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street to [[NBC Studios]] in Burbank. [[KTTV]] (purchased by FOX) pulled up stakes in 1996 from its former home at [[Metromedia Square]] on Sunset Boulevard to relocate to the FOX Studio lot in West Los Angeles. [[KABC-TV]] moved from its original location at ABC Television Center (now branded [[The Prospect Studios]]) just east of Hollywood to [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] in 2000, though the Los Angeles bureau of ABC News still resides at Prospect and still serves as an ABC Network studios facility. After being purchased by [[20th Century Fox]] in 2001, [[KCOP]] left its former home on La Brea Avenue to join KTTV on the Fox lot. The [[CBS Corporation]]-owned [[duopoly]] of [[KCBS-TV]] and [[KCAL-TV]] moved from its longtime home at [[CBS Columbia Square]] on Sunset Boulevard to a new facility at [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]]. [[KTLA]] and [[KCET]], both located on Sunset Boulevard, are the last broadcasters (television or radio) with Hollywood addresses.  However, KCET has since sold its studios on Sunset and plans to move to another location.

In addition, Hollywood once served as the home of nearly every radio station in Los Angeles, all of which have now moved into other communities, especially Burbank, but a fair number also relocated to Wilshire Center and Miracle Mile district with the latter being home to many TV production companies including Mark Goodson and the E! network. [[KNX (AM)|KNX]] was the last station to broadcast from Hollywood, when it left [[CBS Columbia Square]] for a studio in the [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]] in 2005.  While Hollywood was home to several foreign-language radio stations, they too moved to many of the same areas as their English language counter-parts.  In fact, today, not a single L.A. market radio station has operations in Hollywood.

In 2002, a number of Hollywood citizens began a campaign for the district to secede from Los Angeles and become, as it had been a century earlier, its own incorporated municipality. Secession supporters argued that the needs of their community were being ignored by the leaders of Los Angeles. In June of that year, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors placed secession referendums for both Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley on the ballots for a &quot;citywide election.&quot; To pass, they required the approval of a majority of voters in the proposed new municipality as well as a majority of voters in all of Los Angeles. In the November election, both referendums failed by wide margins in the citywide vote.

Hollywood is served by several neighborhood councils, including the Hollywood United Neighborhood Council (HUNC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodunitednc.org/ Hollywood United Neighborhood Council]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsdnc.org/ Hollywood Studio District Neighborhood Council]&lt;/ref&gt; These two groups are part of the network of neighborhood councils certified by the City of Los Angeles Department of Neighborhood Empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://done.lacity.org/ncdatabase/nc_database_public/NCDetail.aspx?ncid=33 Los Angeles Department of Neighborhood Enpowerment]&lt;/ref&gt; Neighborhood Councils cast advisory votes on such issues as zoning, planning, and other community issues. The council members are voted in by stakeholders, generally defined as anyone living, working, owning property, or belonging to an organization within the boundaries of the council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hsdnc.org/modules/smartfaq/ HSDNC.org: FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revitalization===
After many years of serious decline, when many Hollywood landmarks were threatened with demolition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950674-1,00.html Russell Leavitt, In California: A Fading Hollywood, ''TIME magazine'', June 14, 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood is now undergoing rapid [[gentrification]] and revitalization with the goal of [[urban density]] in mind.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Many developments have been completed, typically centered on Hollywood Boulevard. The [[Hollywood and Highland]] complex (site of the [[Kodak Theater]]) has been a major catalyst for the redevelopment of the area. In addition, numerous fashionable bars, [[night club|club]]s, and retail businesses have opened on or surrounding the boulevard, returning Hollywood to a center of nightlife in Los Angeles. Many older buildings have also been converted to lofts and condominiums. The W Hollywood Hotel is now open at the intersection of [[Hollywood and Vine]]

'''Hollywood Boulevard''' is a street in [[Hollywood]], [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], splitting off [[Sunset Boulevard]] in the east and running northwest to [[Vermont Avenue]], where it straightens out and runs due west to [[Laurel Canyon Boulevard]]. West of Laurel Canyon it continues as a small residential street in the hills, finally ending at Sunset Plaza Drive. On the east side of Hollywood Boulevard it passes through the neighborhoods of [[Little Armenia, Los Angeles, California|Little Armenia]] and [[Thai Town, Los Angeles, California|Thai Town]].

The famous street was named [[Prospect Avenue]] from 1887 to 1910, when the town of [[Hollywood]] was annexed to the [[Los Angeles, California|city of Los Angeles]]. After annexation, the street numbers changed from 100 Prospect Avenue, at Vermont Avenue, to 6400 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1946 [[Gene Autry]] rode his horse in the Hollywood Christmas parade and was inspired by the children yelling &quot;Here comes Santa Claus, Here comes Santa Claus,&quot; to write the song &quot;[[Here Comes Santa Claus]]&quot; along with [[Oakley Haldeman]]. Then, the boulevard was nicknamed &quot;Santa Claus Lane&quot;. The [[Hollywood Christmas Parade]] passes down Hollywood Boulevard every Sunday after [[Thanksgiving]].

In 1958, the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], which runs from [[Gower Street (Hollywood)|Gower Street]] to [[La Brea Avenue]], was created as a tribute to artists working in the entertainment industry.  The Walk of Fame recognizes such celebrities and icons as [[Walt Disney]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Hugh Hefner]], and many more. (The Walk runs for an additional 3 blocks on [[Vine Street]].)

The Hollywood extension of the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metro]] [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Red Line]] [[Rapid transit|subway]] was opened in June 1999. Running from [[Downtown Los Angeles|Downtown]] to the [[San Fernando Valley|Valley]], it has stops on Hollywood Boulevard at [[Hollywood/Western (LACMTA station)|Western Avenue]], at [[Hollywood/Vine (LACMTA station)|Vine Street]] and at [[Hollywood/Highland (LACMTA station)|Highland Avenue]]. [[Metro Local]] lines 180, 181 and 217 and [[Metro Rapid]] line 780 serve Hollywood Boulevard. An [[Cruising (driving around)|anti-cruising]] ordinance prohibits driving on part of the boulevard more than twice in four hours.

==Revitalization==
In recent years successful efforts have been made at cleaning up Hollywood Blvd., as the street had gained a reputation for crime and seediness. Central to these efforts was the construction of the [[Hollywood and Highland]] shopping center and adjacent [[Kodak Theatre]] in 2001. With many housing and lofts conversions and a future entertainment complex on the corner of [[Hollywood and Vine]] owned by [[Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide|W Hotels]]. Also, various nightclubs have opened with many celebrities and Hollywood starlets coming in to party, such as [[Paris Hilton]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], and [[Jamie Foxx]], including a new Tex-Mex restaurant on the corner of Hollywood and Ivar by [[Eva Longoria]] called Beso. The street remains one of the major tourist draws in Los Angeles.

In the past several years alone, more than $2 billion has been spent on projects in the neighborhood, including mixed-use retail and apartment complexes and new schools and museums. This Hollywood renaissance represents a potential future for much more of Los Angeles, a sprawling, horizontal city where vertical, dense and mostly walkable neighborhoods with public transportation are increasingly in vogue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/26/news/hollywood.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, it was announced that the clothier [[H&amp;M]] is opening a location just across the street from [[Hollywood and Highland]], and in May 2007, it was announced that the Spanish retail chain [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]] will be opening nearby the new [[Madame Tussauds]] which opened in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodandhighland.com/press_releases_info.php?release=17 Hollywood &amp; Highland Center - Press Releases&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 Revamping===
In early 2006, the city made revamping plans on Hollywood Boulevard for future tourists. The three-part plan was to exchange the original streetlights with red stars into two-headed old-fashioned streetlights, put in new palm trees, and put in new stoplights. The renovations completed in late 2006.

The '''Hollywood Sign''' is a [[landmark]] and [[United States|American]] [[cultural icon]] in the [[Hollywood Hills]] area of [[Mount Lee]], [[Santa Monica Mountains]], in Los Angeles, California. The sign spells out the name of the area in {{convert|45|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}&lt;ref name=&quot;npr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Renée Montagne|title = The Hollywood Sign|work=Present at the Creation|publisher=[[National Public Radio]] Crime Library|date= October 28, 2002|url = http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/hollywoodsign/index.html|accessdate =September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{Convert|350|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} white letters. It was created as an advertisement in 1923, but garnered increasing recognition after the sign was left up.&lt;ref name=&quot;hstpdf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Hollywood Sign Trust|title = The Hollywood Sign|work=A Beat-by-Beat Plotline|publisher=Hollywood Sign Trust|date= May 19, 2005|url = http://www.hollywoodsign.org/pdf/HOLLYWOOD%20PLOTLINE.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate =August 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign was a frequent target of pranks and vandalism but has since undergone restoration, including a security system to deter vandalism. The sign is protected and promoted by the Hollywood Sign Trust, a nonprofit organization.

From the ground, the contours of the hills give the sign its &quot;wavy&quot; appearance, as reflected in the [[:File:Hollywoodvideo logo.jpg|Hollywood Video logo]], for example. When observed at a comparable altitude, as in the photo shown here, the letters appear nearly level.

The sign makes frequent appearances in popular culture, particularly in [[establishing shot]]s for films and television programs set in or around Hollywood, furnished the title for the film ''[[The Hollywood Sign (film)|The Hollywood Sign]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0239467|The Hollywood Sign}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appears in the background of the current CGI fanfare logo of [[20th Century Fox]]. Signs of similar style, but spelling different words, are frequently seen as parodies.

== History ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hollywoodland-Sign.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The original look of the Hollywood Sign]] --&gt;The sign was first erected in 1923 and originally read &quot;HOLLYWOODLAND&quot;. Its purpose was to advertise the name of a new housing development in the hills above the Hollywood district of Los Angeles. [[Hobart Johnstone Whitley|H.J. Whitley]] had already used a sign to advertise his development Whitley Heights, which was located between Highland Avenue and Vine Avenue. He suggested to his friend [[Harry Chandler]], the owner of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' newspaper, that the land syndicate in which he was involved make a similar sign to advertise their land.&lt;ref name=&quot;fatherofhollywood&quot;&gt;The Father of Hollywood by Gaelyn Keith (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate developers Woodruff and Shoults called their development &quot;Hollywoodland&quot; and advertised it as a &quot;superb environment without excessive cost on the Hollywood side of the hills&quot;.&lt;ref name='BeachwoodWilliams'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachwoodcanyon.org/HISTORY.htm |title=The Story of Hollywoodland |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |last=Williams |first=Gregory |publisher=[http://www.beachwoodcanyon.org/ Beachwood Canyon Neighborhood Association] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They contracted the Crescent Sign Company to erect thirteen letters on the hillside, each facing south. The sign company owner, Thomas Fisk Goff (1890–1984) designed the sign. Each letter of the sign was {{convert|30|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|50|ft|m}} high, and the whole sign was studded with some 4,000 light bulbs. The sign was officially dedicated on July 13, 1923. It was not intended to be permanent. Restoration company Bay Cal Painting says on its website that the expected life was to be about a year and a half, but after the rise of the American cinema in Los Angeles it became an internationally recognized symbol, and was left there.

In September 16, 1932 the body of Broadway actress [[Peg Entwistle]] was found in a ravine below the sign. She had been living at her uncle's house in Beachwood Canyon. A suicide note was found in a purse anonymously dropped off at the Hollywood police station. Police surmised Entwistle jumped to her death from the letter ''H''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suicide Laid To Film Jinx|date=September 20, 1932|work=Los Angeles Times|pages=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deterioration ==
[[Image:Hullywod-Sign.jpg|thumb|right|In the 1970s, the sign reached its most dilapidated state.]]
Over the course of more than half a century, the sign, designed to stand only 18 months, sustained a wide array of damage and deterioration.

During the early 1940s, Albert Kothe (the sign's official caretaker) caused an accident that destroyed the letter ''H'',&lt;ref name='BeachwoodLong2006'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tommy Lee and the Hollywoodland Sign|journal=Beachwood Voice|date=Summer 2006|first=Raphael F.|last=Long|volume=9|issue=2|pages=10–11|id= |url=http://www.beachwoodvoice.com/zzArchive/Summer%2006/Page_10_Tuesday___Final.pdf|accessdate=April 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in many historical pictures. Kothe, driving while inebriated, was nearing the top of Mount Lee when he lost control of his vehicle and drove off the cliff behind the ''H''. While Kothe was not injured, the 1928 [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]] was destroyed, as was the letter.

In 1949 the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce began a contract with the City of Los Angeles Parks Department to repair and rebuild the sign. The contract stipulated that &quot;LAND&quot; be removed to spell &quot;Hollywood&quot; and reflect the district, not the &quot;Hollywoodland&quot; housing development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/hollywoodsign/index.html|title=The Hollywood Sign, Present at the Creation|date=October 28, 2002|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parks Department dictated that all subsequent illumination would be at the cost of the Chamber, so the Chamber opted not to replace the light bulbs. The 1949 effort gave it new life, but the sign's unprotected wood and sheet metal structure continued to deteriorate. Eventually the first ''O'' splintered and broke, resembling a lowercase ''u'', and the third ''O'' fell down completely, leaving the severely dilapidated sign reading &quot;HuLLYWO&amp;nbsp;D&quot;.

== Restoration ==
[[Image:HollywoodSignLosAngeles.jpg|thumb|left|The sign from the Hollywood Hills]]
In 1978, in large part because of the public campaign to restore the landmark by [[shock rock]]er [[Alice Cooper]] (who donated the missing ''O''), the Chamber set out to replace the intensely deteriorated sign with a more permanent structure. Nine donors gave US$27,700 each (totaling US$249,300) to sponsor replacement letters made of steel, guaranteed to last for many years (see [[#Donors|Donors]] section below).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The new letters were {{convert|45|ft|m}} tall and ranged from {{convert|31|to|39|ft|m}} wide. The new version of the sign was unveiled on Hollywood's 75th anniversary, November 14, 1978, before a live television audience of 60 million people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Refurbishment, donated by Bay Cal Commercial Painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baycal.com/hsrp/index.html|title=Hollywood Sign Restoration Project 2005|accessdate=January 1, 2008|publisher=Bay Cal Painting}}&lt;/ref&gt; began again in November 2005, as workers stripped the letters back to their metal base and repainted them white. Also in 2005, the original 1923 sign was put up for sale on eBay by producer/entrepreneur Dan Bliss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/11/17/news/newsmakers/hollywood_sign |title=Buy a piece of HOLLYWOOD|author=Jessica Seid|publisher=CNN|date=November 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bliss sold the sign to artist [[Bill Mack (Sculptor)|Bill Mack]].

== Donors ==
[[File:HollywoodSignJAN09.jpg|thumb|The letters on the sign today are 5&amp;nbsp;ft (1.52&amp;nbsp;m) shorter than the original.]]
Following the 1978 public campaign to restore the sign, the following nine donors gave $27,777 each (which totaled $250,000):

* H&amp;nbsp;– Terrence Donnelly&amp;nbsp;– publisher of the ''Hollywood Independent Newspaper''
* O&amp;nbsp;– Giovanni Mazza&amp;nbsp;– Italian movie producer
* L&amp;nbsp;– Les Kelley&amp;nbsp;– originator of the [[Kelley Blue Book]]
* L&amp;nbsp;– [[Gene Autry]]&amp;nbsp;– singer, actor and businessman
* Y&amp;nbsp;– [[Hugh Hefner]]&amp;nbsp;– founder of [[Playboy]] magazine
* W&amp;nbsp;– [[Andy Williams]]&amp;nbsp;– singer
* O&amp;nbsp;– [[Warner Bros. Records]]
* O&amp;nbsp;– [[Alice Cooper]]&amp;nbsp;– singer, who donated in memory of comedian [[Groucho Marx]]
* D&amp;nbsp;– Thomas Pooley&amp;nbsp;— donated in the name of Michael Williams &lt;!-- delinked from inappropriate/general name links; if verified from a source to an article may be relinked --&gt;

== Location ==
[[File:Hollywood sign from farmers market.jpg|thumb|View from [[West Hollywood]], near [[Santa Monica Boulevard]], a few blocks south of [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The historic [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] is visible on the left.]]
The sign is located on the southern side of [[Mount Lee]] in [[Griffith Park]], north of the [[Mulholland Highway]].

The sign is located on rough, steep terrain, and is encompassed by barriers to prevent unauthorized access. In 2000, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] installed a security system featuring motion detection and closed-circuit cameras. Any movement in the marked restricted areas triggers an alarm that notifies the police.&lt;ref name='Hollywoodsign.org 2009-08-2'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodsign.org/signsecurity.html |title=Hollywood Sign |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |date=August 2, 2009 |work=Hollywood Sign Trust }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surrounding land ==
Land in the vicinity of the sign was purchased by [[Howard Hughes]] in 1940, who had planned to build a hilltop mansion at [[Cahuenga Peak]] for actress [[Ginger Rogers]]. Before long Rogers broke up their engagement and the lot remained empty. Hughes Estate sold the property which lies to the left and above the sign for $1.7&amp;nbsp;million in 2002 to Fox River Financial Resources, a Chicago developer, who were interested in building luxury mansions along the ridgeline.&lt;ref name=kabc/&gt; They put the property on the market in 2008 for $22&amp;nbsp;million. As a result, the City of Los Angeles considered buying it, possibly by raising money from celebrities as was done for the 1978 restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The building and tower located just behind that sign is the City of Los Angeles Central Communications Facility. It is a utility building which supports all cellphone, microwave and radio towers used by Los Angeles Police Department, The Fire Department, The Los Angeles Unified School District, and other such agencies.  The building itself has no name, and is filled with electronics. It is essentially a large maintenance building for the antennas.

[[Image:Hollywood Sign February 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The sign as it appeared circa February 2010.]]
Environmentalists and preservationists were concerned about the possibility of real estate development in the area. In April 2009 [[The Trust for Public Land]] (TPL) signed an option to buy the {{convert|138|acre|km2}} property for a discounted price of $12.5&amp;nbsp;million. On February 11, 2010, as part of a campaign to help raise money the organization, with the full blessing of both the city and the Hollywood Sign Trust, covered the sign with a large banner reading &quot;SAVE THE PEAK&quot;.&lt;ref name=kabc&gt;{{cite web | title=Preservation campaigners cover Hollywood sign | url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&amp;id=7272149 | date=February 11, 2010 | publisher=KABC-TV | accessdate=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;savehollywoodland&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Behind the Sign: The Great Cover-Up |url=http://www.savehollywoodland.org/homepage/pictures-of-the-hollywood-sign-during-the-wrapping/ |publisher=[[Save Cahuenga Peak]] |date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 26, The Trust for Public Land announced it had raised enough money, with [[Playboy]] magazine founder [[Hugh Hefner]] stepping forward to donate the final $900,000.&lt;ref name='SaveCahuenga'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savehollywoodland.org/homepage/hugh-hefner-is-final-donor-land-around-hollywood-sign-saved/ |title=Hugh Hefner is Final Donor, Land Around Hollywood Sign Saved |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |date=April 26, 2010 |work=Save Cahuenga Peak |publisher=The Trust for Public Land }} [http://www.webcitation.org/5pJ0jvhxG Archived version April 27, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Sign.org'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodsign.org/savethepeak.html |title=Original Benefactor Hugh Hefner Returns as Final Donor to Save Land Surrounding Hollywood Sign |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |date=April 26, 2010 |publisher=Hollywood Sign Trust, Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, and City of Los Angeles}} [http://www.webcitation.org/5pJ0Cq5iA Archived version April 27, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Hefner later gave an additional $100,000 donation.

== Alterations ==

It is illegal to make unauthorized physical alterations to the sign. Although the city has occasionally allowed it in the past for commercial purposes, current policy does not permit changes to be made. This is largely due to neighborhood opposition and to past accidents. However, the sign has been unofficially altered a number of times, often eliciting a great deal of attention. Among the more famous modifications:

*HOLLYWeeD&amp;nbsp;– January 1976, following the passage of a state law decriminalizing marijuana.&lt;ref name=&quot;finegood&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Valerie J. |last=Nelson |title=Danny Finegood, who found fame with &quot;Hollyweed&quot; stunt, dies at age 52 |url=http://hightimes.com/news/dan/3790 |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=January 28, 2009 |accessdate=September 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*HOLYWOOD&amp;nbsp;– April 1977, for Easter sunrise service, viewable from the Hollywood Bowl.&lt;ref name=&quot;finegood&quot;/&gt;
*HOL YWOOD&amp;nbsp;– 1978 the second L was covered for Pope John Paul II when he visited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/jun/11/ | location=London}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;GO NAVY&quot; December 1983, when a group of Midshipmen, with permission, covered the sign for the ARMY-NAVY football game's first and only West Coast appearance (D.

'''''Hollywood''''' (also known as '''''Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film''''') is a [[1980 in television|1980]] [[documentary film|documentary]] series produced by [[Thames Television]] which explored the establishment and development of the [[Hollywood]] [[film studio|studios]] and its impact on 1920s culture.

==Synopsis==
The series consisted of thirteen one hour episodes, with each episode dealing with a specific aspect of Hollywood history. The actor [[James Mason]], an enthusiast of the period, supplied the [[narration]]; a lilting score was contributed by [[Carl Davis]].

Technical quality was an important aspect of the production. Silent films had often been screened on television from poor-quality copies running at the wrong speed, usually accompanied by honky tonk piano music. ''Hollywood'' used silent film clips that were sourced from the best available material, shown at their original running speed and with orchestral scores, giving viewers a chance to see what they originally looked and sounded like.

The producers recorded the recollections of many of the period's notable artists, and illustrated their interviews with scenes from their various films, as well as production still photographs, and historical photographs of the Los Angeles environs. Subjects such as [[Rudolph Valentino]] and [[Clara Bow]] were represented by film scenes, but where possible the series made use of contemporary interviews by survivors of the era.  Some of these interviews are notable for being among the only filmed interviews given by their subjects.

Among the notable people who contributed interviews were:

'''Actors''' - [[Mary Astor]], [[Eleanor Boardman]], [[Louise Brooks]], [[Olive Carey]], [[Iron Eyes Cody]], [[Jackie Coogan]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Viola Dana]], [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], [[Janet Gaynor]], [[Leatrice Joy]], [[Lillian Gish]], [[Bessie Love]], [[Ben Lyon]], [[Tim McCoy]], [[Colleen Moore]], [[Charles Rogers (actor)|Charles 'Buddy' Rogers]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Blanche Sweet]], [[John Wayne]] (in one of his last interviews), and [[Lois Wilson (actress)|Lois Wilson]].

'''Directors''' - [[Dorothy Arzner]] (in her last interview), [[Clarence Brown]], [[Frank Capra]], [[George Cukor]], [[Allan Dwan]], [[Byron Haskin]], [[Henry Hathaway]], [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]], [[Lewis Milestone]], [[Hal Roach]], [[Albert S. Rogell]], [[King Vidor]] and [[William Wyler]]. 

Also interviewed were choreographer [[Agnes de Mille]], writer [[Anita Loos]], writer [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]], press agent/writer [[Cedric Belfrage]], organist [[Gaylord Carter]], cinematographer [[George J. Folsey]], writer [[Jesse L. Lasky, Jr.]], cinematographer [[Lee Garmes]], special effects artist [[A. Arnold Gillespie]], [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]], agent [[Paul Kohner]], producer/writer [[Samuel Marx (film producer)|Samuel Marx]], editors [[William Hornbeck]] and [[Grant Whytock]], stuntmen [[Yakima Canutt]] and [[Harvey Parry]], and Rudolph Valentino's brother, Albert Valentino.

==Episode list==
*'''&quot;The Pioneers&quot;''' - The evolution of film from penny arcade curiosity to art form, from what was considered the first plot driven film, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', through to ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', films showing the power of the medium. Early Technicolor footage, along with other color technologies, are also featured. Interviews include Lillian Gish, Jackie Coogan and King Vidor.

*'''&quot;In the Beginning&quot;''' - Hollywood is transformed from a peaceful village with dusty streets and lemon groves to the birthplace of the industry in California. Silent film transcends international boundaries to become a worldwide phenomenon. Interviews include Henry King, Agnes de Mille, and Lillian Gish.

*'''&quot;Single Beds and Double Standards&quot;''' - Fast success in Hollywood brings a cavalier party lifestyle, which led to shocking scandals such as [[Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle]]'s trial and subsequent acquittal for manslaughter. To tone down the image of Hollywood and curtail films with footage unsuitable to all audiences, [[Will H. Hays]] is appointed and introduces Hollywood's self regulated [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]], which would be enforced well into the 1960s, while filmmakers still found creative ways to present 'adult' situations. Interviews include King Vidor and Gloria Swanson.

*'''&quot;Hollywood Goes To War&quot;''' - The outbreak of World War I provides Hollywood with a successful source for plots and profits. Peacetime curtails the release of war movies, until the release of King Vidor's ''[[The Big Parade]]'' in 1925. ''[[Wings (film)|Wings]]'' (1927) earns the first [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. As movies transition to sound, Universal releases [[Lewis Milestone]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', showing the German side of the conflict, becoming a powerful statement of war by the generation that fought it. Interviews include Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., King Vidor and Lillian Gish.

*'''&quot;Hazard of the Game&quot;''' - Silent films are often remembered for slapstick gags and dangerous stunts. Stuntmen took anonymous credit for very little pay and could not reveal their involvement. Stuntmen Yakima Canutt, Harvey Parry, Bob Rose and Paul Malvern tell hair-raising and humorous stories, and reveal the secrets behind many famous stunts.

*'''&quot;Swanson and Valentino&quot;''' - Two of the great romantic legends of the silent screen are profiled. Rudolph Valentino's on-screen persona is remarkably different from his real personal life, as recounted by his brother, Albert, and Gloria Swanson recalls her meteoric rise - and fall - with remarkable candor.

*'''&quot;The Autocrats&quot;''' - Two of Hollywood's greatest directors, [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and [[Erich von Stroheim]]. One worked with the Hollywood system, the other against it. DeMille's pictures, lavish in detail and cost, made his studio a fortune, while Von Stroheim's similar ways, albeit to excess in footage and expense, resulted in films that were often either excessively cut by the studios or never released, leading to his being fired on several occasions. Interviews include Agnes DeMille, Gloria Swanson and Henry King.

*'''&quot;Comedy - A Serious Business&quot;''' - Hollywood learned very early how to make people laugh. Comedy was king, and battling for the throne were stars like [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Harry Langdon]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]]. In a purely visual medium, their comedy was a work of genius. Interviews include Hal Roach, Sr., Jackie Coogan, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd

*'''&quot;Out West&quot;''' - 'The Old West' was still in existence in the silent days. Old cowboys and outlaws re-lived their youth, and got paid for doing it, by working in films. The 'western craze' really begins with stars like [[Buffalo Bill|William &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody]] and [[Tom Mix]]. Interviews include Yakima Canutt, Colonel Tim McCoy, Harvey Parry and John Wayne.

*'''&quot;The Man With the Megaphone&quot;''' - Silent film directors were flamboyant pioneers, making up their technique as they went along. Filming 'indoor' sets on open outdoor lots and combating the elements, communicating with actors in spite of overwhelming distraction and deafening noise, directors (male ''and'' female) fashion great films out of chaos and confusion. Interviews include Bessie Love, Janet Gaynor, and King Vidor.

*'''&quot;Trick of the Light&quot;''' - Skilled cameramen had the ability to turn an actress into a screen goddess, and were valuable assets to studios and stars. With the aid of art directors, they achieved some of the most amazing and dangerous sequences captured on film, pioneering photography effects used through the remainder of the 20th century. Interviews include William Wyler and Lillian Gish.

*'''&quot;Star Treatment&quot;''' - Producers discovered the effect of 'star power' on their box office bottom line. Creating Hollywood stars becomes its own industry, resulting in the Hollywood Star System, from which came Clara Bow, Lillian Gish, and John Gilbert, successor to Rudolph Valentino as &quot;The Great Lover&quot;. But as easily as they made them, studios could break them. Interviews include Charles &quot;Buddy&quot; Rogers, Louise Brooks and King Vidor.

*'''&quot;End of an Era&quot;''' - Silent films had universal appeal, simply by replacing intertitles and dialogue cards for the foreign markets. Sound film was experimented with in many forms since the 1890s, but did not become commercially successful until ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' in 1927. Hollywood movie making was transformed and ultimately shattered, taking the careers of many silent film stars, directors and producers with it, victims of the emerging technology. Interviews include Lillian Gish, Mary Astor, Janet Gaynor, George Cukor and Frank Capra, Sr.

==Merchandise==
Uniquely for a relatively specialised programme, Thames Television invested in a series of tie-in products: a book accompanying the series, written by Brownlow, Gill and [[John Kobal]], a soundtrack LP featuring Carl Davis' music, a 7&quot; single of the main theme, a pictoral newspaper-style publication featuring many of the stills used in the production and several posters bearing the ''Hollywood'' logo, licensed from various picture libraries.

==Home video and DVD releases==
In North America, the series was released in 1990 by [[HBO Video]] on [[VHS]] and [[laserdisc]]. Attempts to release the series on DVD in the UK in 2006 were met with legal entanglements of copyright issues and clip clearances, due to the overwhelming number of participants and film clips involved in the series, although it had been briefly made available in a few online stores in the UK before being quickly pulled.

The '''Hollywood Walk of Fame''' consists of more than 2,400 five-pointed [[terrazzo]] and [[brass]] stars embedded in the [[sidewalk]]s along fifteen [[city block|blocks]] of [[Hollywood Boulevard]] and three blocks of [[Vine Street]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]]. The stars are permanent public monuments to achievement in the [[entertainment industry]], bearing the names of a mix of actors, musicians, directors, producers, musical and theatrical groups, fictional characters, and others, paid for by the honoree cited on the star.  The Walk of Fame is administered by the Hollywood [[chamber of commerce|Chamber of Commerce]] and maintained by the self-financing Hollywood Historic Trust. It is a popular tourist destination, with a reported 10 million visitors in 2003.&lt;!-- detail moved to Description--&gt;

The Walk of Fame runs 1.3 miles (2.1&amp;nbsp;km) east to west on Hollywood Boulevard from North Gower Street to [[La Brea Avenue|North La Brea Avenue]], plus a short segment of Marshfield Way that runs diagonally between Hollywood and La Brea; and 0.4 miles (0.7&amp;nbsp;km) north to south on Vine Street between Yucca Street and [[Sunset Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google maps | url = http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;geocode=&amp;sll=34.101328,-118.345028&amp;sspn=0.01258,0.019913&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=17&amp;g=hollywood+walk+of+fame&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=117190891409591437357.0004523d1113b0dc7a67d | accessdate = May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the upper portion of the pink star field, the name of the honoree is inlaid in brass block letters. Below the inscription, in the lower half of the star field, a round inlaid brass emblem indicates the category of the honoree's contributions. The emblems symbolize five categories within the entertainment industry:
:: [[File:Walk of Fame Category Motion Pictures.jpg|40px]] '''''Classic film camera''''' representing [[film|motion pictures]]
:: [[File:Walk of Fame Category Television.jpg|40px]] '''''Television receiver''''' representing [[Terrestrial television|broadcast television]]

:: [[File:Walk of Fame Category Theater.jpg|40px]] '''''Comedy/tragedy masks''''' representing [[theatre]]/[[Play (theatre)|live performance]] (added in 1984)
Of [[List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame|all the stars on the Walk to date]], 47% have been awarded in the motion pictures category, 24% in television, 17% in audio recording, 10% in radio, and less than 2% in the live performance category.&lt;!-- Simple arithmetic on the List itself. Per [[WP:CALC]], discussed in Talk, consensus obtained. Need link to the List in the para, or previous to it. --&gt; An average of twenty new stars are added to the Walk each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOFFAQ&quot;/&gt;

According to a 2003 report by the market research firm NPO Plog Research, the Walk attracts about 10 million visitors annually&amp;nbsp;— more than [[Sunset Strip]], [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], the ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'', and the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]&amp;nbsp;— and has played an important role in making tourism the largest industry in [[Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref name=Martin1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/article/120480-over-50-years-walk-of-fame-turned-hollywood-into-destination/|title=Over 50 years, Walk of Fame turned Hollywood into destination|last=Martin|first=Hugo|date=February 8, 2010|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee was formed to flesh out the idea, and an architectural firm was retained to develop specific proposals. By 1955, the basic concept and general design had been agreed upon, and plans were submitted to the [[Los Angeles City Council]]. 

In February 1956, a prototype was unveiled featuring a [[caricature]] of an example honoree ([[John Wayne]], by some accounts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=David|title=The Whole Equation: A History of Hollywood|publisher=Vintage|year=2006|isbn=0-3757015-4-0|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; inside a blue star on a brown background.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyof&quot;/&gt; However, caricatures proved too expensive and difficult to execute in brass with the technology available at the time; and the brown and blue motif was nixed by [[C. E. Toberman]], the legendary real estate developer known as &quot;Mr. Hollywood&quot;, because the colors clashed with a new building he was erecting on Hollywood Boulevard.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyof&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Gregory Paul|year=2006|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9W4R_CZtFe8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Story of Hollywood: An Illustrated History|publisher=BL Press|isbn=978-0-9776299-0-9|accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple accounts exist for the origin of the &quot;star&quot; concept. According to one, the historic [[Hollywood Hotel]], which stood for over 50 years on Hollywood Boulevard at the site now occupied by the [[Hollywood and Highland|Hollywood and Highland complex]] and the [[Kodak Theatre]], painted stars on its dining room ceiling over tables favored by its most famous celebrity patrons, and that may have served as an early inspiration.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hollywood-walk-of-fame6-2010feb06-pictures,0,3869071.photogallery|title=The Hollywood Walk of Fame {{!}} A brief history in photos|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another account states that the stars were &quot;inspired both by the foot- and handprints outside [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese (Theater)]] and by Sugarman's old drinks menu, which featured celebrity photos framed in gold stars&quot; at his restaurant, The Tropics.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Magazine&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Martin|last=Townsend|title=Los Angeles History - Extinct Restaurants &amp; Cafes S-Z|publisher=LATimeMachines.com|url=http://www.latimemachines.com/new_page_43.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061020123952/http://www.latimemachines.com/new_page_43.htm|archivedate=2006-10-20|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;!-- ownership only --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection and construction===
By March 1956, the final design and coral-and-charcoal color scheme had been approved, and between the spring of 1956 and the fall of 1957, 1,558 honorees were selected by committees representing the four branches of the entertainment industry at that time: motion pictures, television, audio recording, and radio. The committees met at the [[Brown Derby]] restaurant,&lt;ref name=&quot;ap2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.azcentral.com/ent/movies/articles/0630walkoffame0630.html|title= Price of Fame in Hollywood? $15,000|author=Cohen, Sandy|newspaper=The Arizona Republic|date=June 30, 2006|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included such prominent names as [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[Jesse Lasky]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Hal Roach]], [[Mack Sennett]], and [[Walter Lantz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historyof&quot;/&gt;

As the members of the audio recording committee worked at compiling their Walk of Fame list, they realized that there were many people important to the music industry who would not qualify for a Walk of Fame star. They decided to create an award of their own to honor those in the music business&amp;nbsp;— the [[Grammy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aSBAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z1gMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3612,4838071&amp;dq=paul+weston+grammy&amp;hl=en|title=Bronze Stars Begot Grammy|date=February 22, 1976|page=13|newspaper=The Robesonian|location=Lumberton, N.C.|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began in 1958, but two lawsuits delayed completion. The first was filed by local property owners challenging the legality of the [[USD]] $1.25 million tax assessment levied upon them to pay for the Walk, along with new street lighting and trees. In October 1959 the assessment was ruled legal.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyof&quot;/&gt; The second, filed by [[Charles Chaplin, Jr.]], sought damages for the exclusion of his father, [[Charlie Chaplin]], whose nomination had been withdrawn due to pressure from multiple quarters. Chaplin's suit was dismissed in 1960, paving the way for completion of the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyof&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/446780962.html?dids=446780962:446780962&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug+11%2C+1960&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Judge+Refuses+Chaplin+Walk+of+Fame+Request&amp;pqatl=google|title=Judge Refuses Chaplin Walk of Fame Request|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 11, 1960|page=B2|accessdate=June 11, 2010}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesWhy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/#no-love|title=Why doesn't Clint Eastwood have a star?|accessdate=May 20, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stagnation and revitalization===
Though the Walk was originally conceived, in part, to encourage redevelopment of Hollywood Boulevard, the 1960s and 1970s were a period of protracted urban decay in the Hollywood area as residents moved to suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuitt|first=Doug|date=April 16, 1972|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/641601432.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr+16%2C+1972&amp;author=DOUG+SHUIT&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(1923-Current+File)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=AB&amp;desc=Hollywood+Blvd.---The+Old+Glamor+Has+Vanished|title=Hollywood Blvd.---The Old Glamor Has Vanished|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vincent1&gt;{{cite news|author=Vincent, Roger|date=May 6, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/06/business/fi-hollyangst6|title=Neighborhood face-lift gives Hollywood pause|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From the initial installation of over 1500 stars in 1960–1961, eight years&lt;!-- [[WP:CALC]] --&gt; passed without the addition of a new star, as the Los Angeles City Council in 1962 passed an ordinance naming the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce &quot;the agent to advise the City&quot; about adding names to the Walk, and the Chamber, over the next six years, devised rules, procedures, and financing methods to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyof&quot;/&gt;

===Expansion===
In 1984, a fifth category, &quot;Live Theatre&quot; was added to permit acknowledgement of contributions from the live performance branch of the entertainment industry, and a second row of stars was created on each sidewalk to alternate with the existing stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyof&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Hollywood-walk-of-fame.jpg|thumb|left|Hollywood Boulevard, 7000 block, north side, looking westward.]]

In 1994, the Walk of Fame was extended one block to the west on Hollywood Boulevard, from Sycamore Avenue to North LaBrea Avenue (plus the short segment of Marshfield Way that connects Hollywood and La Brea), where it now ends at the silver &quot;Four Ladies of Hollywood&quot; gazebo and the special &quot;Walk of Fame&quot; star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hwof.com/star/special/hollywood-walk-of-fame/3|title=&quot;Hollywood Walk of Fame&quot; star|publisher=HWOF LLC|work=hwof.com|accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Sophia Loren]] was honored with the 2,000th star on the Walk.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyof&quot;/&gt;

The project began with an evaluation of all 2,365 stars on the Walk at the time, each receiving a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F. Honorees whose stars received &quot;F&quot; grades, indicating the most severe damage, were [[Joan Collins]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Dick Van Patten]], [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]], [[Andrew L. Stone]], [[Willard Waterman]], [[Richard Boleslavski]], [[Ellen Drew]], [[Frank Crumit]], and [[Bobby Sherwood]]. 50 celebrities' stars received &quot;D&quot; grades.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT22&quot; /&gt;

The ongoing restoration project is a collaboration between the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and various Los Angeles city and county governmental offices, along with the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], which operates the [[Metro Red Line (LACMTA)|Metro Red Line]] that runs beneath the Walk, since earth movement due to the presence of the subway line is thought to be partly responsible for the damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOFfix&quot;/&gt;

To provide funding for the restoration project, the &quot;Friends of Walk of Fame&quot; program was inaugurated, whereby commercial interests may contribute funds toward the restoration effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT22&quot;/&gt; [[Absolut Vodka]] became the first &quot;Friend&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;KPCC&quot;/&gt; with a donation of $1 million,&lt;ref name=AdAge1&gt;{{cite news|date=January 4, 2010|url=http://adage.com/article/madisonvine-news/brands-join-stars-hollywood-walk-fame-1m-price-tag/141260/|title=Brands Join the Stars on Hollywood Walk of Fame-- at $1M Price Tag|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|work=Advertising Age|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[L'Oreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_13598799|title=L 'Oreal Paris gets a Friend of the Walk of Fame award|work=Los Angeles Daily News|date=October 20, 2009|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends are recognized with honorary plaques adjacent to the Walk of Fame in front of the Kodak Theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;LATAbs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KPCC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=AdAge1/&gt;

The program received some criticism: [[Alana Semuels]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' referred to it as &quot;just the latest corporate attempt to buy some good buzz,&quot; and quoted an area brand strategist: &quot;I think Johnny Grant would roll over in his grave to hear that a commercial entity was doing something to play with the concept of being immortalized.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATAbs&quot;/&gt; Karen Fondu, President of L'Oréal Paris, stated, &quot;Given the number of celebrities we have used as spokespersons for our brand, it was a natural affinity.&quot;&lt;ref name=AdAge1/&gt;

[[Charlie Chaplin]] is the only honoree to be selected twice for the same star on the Walk. He was unanimously voted into the initial group of 500 in 1956, but the Selection Committee ultimately excluded him, ostensibly due to questions regarding his morals (he had been charged with violating the [[Mann Act]]&amp;nbsp;— and exonerated&amp;nbsp;— during the &quot;[[White slave trade|White Slavery]]&quot; hysteria of the 1940s) but more likely due to his left-leaning political views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/23/newsid_3055000/3055581.stm &quot;On This Day: September 23, 1952: Charlie Chaplin Comes Home&quot;]. BBC. Retrieved 2010-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebuke prompted an unsuccessful lawsuit by his son, Charles Chaplin, Jr. His star was finally added to the Walk in 1972, the same year he received his [[Academy Award]];&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesWhy&quot;/&gt; but even then, 16 years later, the Chamber of Commerce received angry letters from across the country protesting its decision to include him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuit|first=Doug|date=April 9, 1972|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/641550802.html?dids=641550802:641550802&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr+09%2C+1972&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times|title=Bitterness Survives 20 Years&amp;nbsp;— They Haven't Given Up -- Letter Writers Assail Chaplin|newspaper=Los Angeles Times (archive)|page=B2|accessdate=2010-08-31}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 the committee, perhaps recalling its Chaplin difficulties, voted against awarding a star to the controversial opera singer, actor, athlete, writer, lawyer, and social activist [[Paul Robeson]]. The outcry from the entertainment industry, civic circles, local and national politicians, and many other quarters was so intense that the decision was almost immediately reversed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qualles&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Qualles|first=Paris H.|year=1979|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RojdPXqpnC4C&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=paul+robeson+mayor+bradley+walk+of+fame&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=asnSZ27W-O&amp;sig=cvB4NlbfBaDJiyHbyHYx5hKVVcQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1NYPTMKGOYL58Abyp-CKCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=paul%20robeson%20mayor%20bradley%20walk%20of%20fame&amp;f=false|title=What Price a Star?

===Names in common===
Two pairs of stars share  identical names representing different people. There are two Harrison Ford stars, honoring [[Harrison Ford (silent film actor)|the silent film actor]] (at 6665 Hollywood Boulevard), and [[Harrison Ford|the present-day actor]] (in front of the Kodak Theatre at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard). Two Michael Jackson stars represent the [[Michael Jackson|singer/dancer/songwriter]] (at 6927 Hollywood Boulevard), and the [[Michael Jackson (radio commentator)|radio personality]] (at 1597 Vine Street). When the singer/songwriter Jackson died, in 2009, fans mistakenly began leaving flowers, candles, and other tributes at the Vine Street star. Upon learning of this, the radio host Jackson wrote on his web site, &quot;I am willingly loan[ing] it to him and, if it would bring him back, he can have it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MJTalk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaeljacksontalkradio.com/MJ_Journals/MJs_09_0625.html|last=Jackson|first=Michael|title=Michael Jackson Talk Radio Content, June 25, 2009|work=M J Journals blog|publisher=MichaelJacksonTalkRadio.com|date=June 25, 2009|accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walk of Fame rules prohibit consideration of nominees whose contributions fall outside the five major entertainment categories, but the selection committee has been known to conjure some interesting rule interpretations to justify a selection. The Walk's four round Moon landing monuments at the corners of Hollywood and Vine, for example, officially recognize the [[Apollo XI]] astronauts for &quot;contributions to the television industry.&quot; Johnny Grant acknowledged, in 2005, that classifying the first Moon landing as a television entertainment event was &quot;a bit of a stretch.&quot; [[Magic Johnson]]'s considerable [[basketball]] skills had no direct connection to movies, music, TV, radio, or theater, but the committee added him to the motion picture category, based on his ownership of the [[Magic Johnson Theatres|Magic Johnson Theatre]] chain, citing as precedent [[Sid Grauman]], builder of [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt; &quot;[Now] people want [[Orville Redenbacher]],&quot; Grant quipped in the 2005 interview, &quot;because his popcorn is in all the theaters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;

[[Muhammad Ali]]'s star was granted after the committee decided that [[boxing]] could be considered a form of &quot;live performance.&quot; His star is the first (and so far only) one to be installed on a vertical surface.

Eleven stars are identified with a one-word [[stage name]]. The most novel is [[Parkyakarkus]], the principal pseudonym of [[Harry Einstein]], the comedian and radio personality (and father of [[Albert Brooks]] and [[Bob Einstein]]). The other ten are [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Liberace]], [[Cantinflas]], [[William Meiklejohn|Meiklejohn]], [[Paderewski]], [[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]], [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]], [[Harry Houdini|Houdini]], [[Roseanne Barr|Roseanne]], and [[Shakira]].

[[Clayton Moore]] is so inextricably linked with his [[Lone Ranger]] character, even though he played other roles during his career, that he is one of only two actors to have his character's name alongside his own on his star. The other is [[Tommy Riggs and Betty Lou|Tommy Riggs]], whose star reads, &quot;Tommy Riggs &amp; Betty Lou.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vitty, Cort (June 2007).

For more than 40 years, singer [[Jimmy Boyd]] was the youngest star recipient at age 20, but he lost that distinction in 2004 to 18-year-old twins [[Mary-Kate Olsen|Mary-Kate]] and [[Ashley Olsen]]. Their joint star (the only one shared by twins) is outside the Kodak Theatre, near the [[Hollywood and Highland|Hollywood and Highland Center]].

[[Westmore family|The Westmores]] received the first star honoring contributions in [[Theatrical makeup|theatrical make-up]]. Other make-up artists on the walk are [[Max Factor]] and [[John Chambers (make-up artist)|John Chambers]]. Three stars recognize experts in [[Special Effects (film)|special effects]]: [[Ray Harryhausen]], [[Dennis Muren]], and [[Stan Winston]].

===Fictional characters (and those who create them)===
{{main|Fictional characters on the Hollywood Walk of Fame}}
[[File:Mickey Mouse star in Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|alt=closeup of Mickey Mouse star, showing title and Motion Picture emblem|[[Mickey Mouse]]'s star was the first awarded to a fictional character]]
In 1978, in honor of his 50th anniversary, [[Mickey Mouse]] became the first animated character to receive a star. Other animated recipients are [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Woody Woodpecker]], [[Snow White (Disney)|Snow White]], [[Tinker Bell]], [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]], [[Rugrats]], and the [[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]. The star inscribed [[Charlie Tuna]] honors not the animated advertising mascot, but the long-time radio personality (real name: Art Ferguson).

Other fictional characters on the Walk include The [[Munchkins]] (as mentioned), two Muppets ([[Kermit the Frog]] and [[Big Bird]]), one monster ([[Godzilla]]), and three non-animated canine characters ([[Strongheart]], [[Lassie]], and [[Rin Tin Tin]]). [[The Muppets]] will receive a collective star in 2012, making Kermit and Big Bird the first fictional characters with two stars.

Eight stars recognize cartoonists and animators: [[Walt Disney]], [[Friz Freleng]], [[Chuck Jones]], [[Walter Lantz]], [[Dr. Seuss]], [[Charles Schulz]], [[Hanna-Barbera]], and [[Jay Ward]] with [[Matt Groening]] due to receive a star in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bacalzo|first=Dan|title=Richard Burton, Hal David, Patricia Heaton, Scarlett Johansson, et al. to Be 2012 Walk of Fame Honorees|url=http://www.theatermania.com/los-angeles/news/06-2011/richard-burton-hal-david-patricia-heaton-scarlett_38362.html|publisher=Theater Mania|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three puppeteers have stars: [[Jim Henson]], [[Shari Lewis]], and [[Fran Allison]].

==Star locations==
Locations of individual stars are not necessarily random or arbitrary. Stars of legendary and world-famous celebrities, the so-called &quot;show business royalty&quot;, are mostly found in front of [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]]. [[Oscars|Oscar]] winners' stars are usually placed near the Kodak Theatre, site of the annual [[Academy Awards]] presentations. Decisions are occasionally made with a dollop of whimsy: [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]'s star, for example, lies in front of an adult store called the International Love Boutique, an association with his [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] roles; [[Roger Moore]]'s star is located at 7007 Hollywood Boulevard in recognition of his seven [[James Bond]] films; and the last star, at the very end of the westernmost portion of the Walk, belongs to [[The Dead End Kids]]. Honorees are typically given input into choice of location, although final decisions remain with the Chamber.&lt;ref name = &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;

In her 1986 memoir, actor/comedienne [[Carol Burnett]] explained her very specific location choice: While working as an usherette at the historic Warner Brothers Theatre (now the [[Hollywood Pacific Theatre]]) during the 1951 run of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'', she took it upon herself to advise a couple arriving during the final few minutes of a showing to wait for the next showing, to avoid seeing (and spoiling) the ending. The theatre manager fired her on the spot for &quot;insubordination&quot; and humiliated her by stripping the epaulets from her uniform in the theatre lobby. In 1977 when she was awarded a star, the Chamber asked if she had a preference for its placement. &quot;Right in front of where the old Warner Brothers Theatre was,&quot; she replied, &quot;at Hollywood and Wilcox.&quot; And that, she added, is exactly where you will find it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnett&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=One More Time|last=Burnett|first=Carol|authorlink=Carol Burnett|year=1986|publisher=Random House|location=New York |isbn=0-394-55254-7|edition=first|pages=194–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atop the obelisk is a small gilded weathervane-style sculpture of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in her iconic &quot;billowing skirt&quot; pose from ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justabovesunset.com/photography/html/the_silver_women.html &quot;The Silver Women&quot; (photo montage)].

The work was dedicated February 1, 1994, to a mixed reception. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' art critic Christopher Knight called it &quot;the most depressingly awful work of public art in recent years,&quot; representing the opposite of Hardwicke's intended tribute to women. He wrote, &quot;Sex as a woman's historic gateway to Hollywood couldn't be more explicitly described.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knight|first=Christopher|date=January 19, 1994|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-19/entertainment/ca-13098_1_la-brea-gateway|title=Caution: Bad Art Up Ahead|newspaper=Los Angeles Times (archives)|accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent writer and film producer Gail Choice, however, called it a fitting tribute to a group of pioneering, courageous women who &quot;carried a tremendous burden on their feminine shoulders,&quot; as depicted quite literally in Hardwicke's gazebo. &quot;Never in my wildest dreams did I believe I'd ever see [[women of color]] immortalized in such a creative and wonderful fashion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Choice|first=Gale|date=February 14, 1994|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-14/entertainment/ca-22913_1_pioneering-women|title=These Women Were Dreamers and Doers|newspaper=Los Angeles Times (archives)|accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardwicke herself contended that critics had missed the &quot;humor and symbolism&quot; of the structure, which &quot;embraces and pokes fun at the glamour, the polished metallic male form of the [[Academy Award|Oscar]], and the pastiche of styles and dreams that pervades [[Tinseltown]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hardwicke|first= Catherine|date=February 14, 1994|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-14/entertainment/ca-22915_1_art-critic|title=Critic Missed the Humor and Symbolism|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the stars, which weigh about 300 pounds (136&amp;nbsp;kg) each, have been stolen from the Walk of Fame. In 2000, [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]]'s and [[Kirk Douglas]]'s stars disappeared from their locations near the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, where they had been temporarily removed for a construction project. Police recovered them in the suburban community of [[South Gate, California|South Gate]] when they arrested a man involved in an incident there and searched his house. The suspect was a construction worker employed on the Hollywood and Vine project. The stars had been badly damaged, and had to be remade. One of [[Gene Autry]]'s five stars (it is not clear which one) was also stolen from a construction area. Johnny Grant later received an anonymous phone tip that the missing star was in Iowa, but it was never found. &quot;Someday, it will end up on eBay,&quot; Grant once joked. The most brazen and ambitious theft occurred in 2005, when thieves used a concrete saw to remove [[Gregory Peck]]'s star from its Hollywood Boulevard site at the intersection of North El Centro Ave, near North Gower. The star was replaced almost immediately, but the original was never recovered and the perpetrators never caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=November 30, 2005|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/30/local/me-star30|title=A Star is Torn from Boulevard|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, rumors circulated widely on media outlets and the Internet that [[John Lennon]]'s star had been stolen, but it was merely being relocated further south on Vine Street to an area near the circular [[Capitol Records Building]], adjacent to the stars of bandmates [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockstarweekly.com/john-lennon-walk-of-fame-star-not-stolen.html &quot;John Lennon's star not stolen&quot;].

==Nomination process==
[[File:JamesCameronStarDec09.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Director James Cameron squats by his new star, left hand propping up his plaque|Director [[James Cameron]] unveiling his star, December 2009]]
Each year, an average of 200 nominations are submitted to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce Walk of Fame Selection Committee. Anyone, including fans, can nominate anyone active in the field of entertainment, as long as the nominee or his or her management is in agreement with the nomination (a letter of agreement from the nominated celebrity or representative must accompany the application). Nominees must have a minimum of five years' experience in the category for which they are nominated and a history of &quot;charitable contributions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jet111&quot;/&gt; Posthumous nominees must have been deceased at least five years. At a meeting each June, the committee selects approximately 20 celebrities to receive stars on the Walk of Fame during the following year. One posthumous award is given each year as well. The nominations of those not selected are &quot;rolled over&quot; to the following year for reconsideration; those not selected two years in a row are dropped, and must be renominated to receive further consideration. Living recipients must agree to personally attend a presentation ceremony within five years of selection. A relative of deceased recipients must attend posthumous presentations.  Presentation ceremonies are open to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOFFAQ&quot;/&gt;

The most common question received by Chamber personnel is, &quot;Why doesn't _____________ have a star?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martinez&quot;&gt;Martinez, Ana. Spokesperson, [http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/ Hollywood Chamber of Commerce] Personal communication, June 1, 2010. {{dubious|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- .org is Florida, .net is L.A. -- see Talk --&gt; Numerous major entertainment figures and legendary show business acts are not included on the Walk of Fame, for a variety of reasons. Some, such as [[Julia Roberts]]&lt;ref name = &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UPITen&quot;&gt;[http://www.upi.com/News_Photos/Entertainment/Ten-celebrities-who-deserve-the-Walk-of-Fame-more-than-Tinker-Bell/3855/1 &quot;Ten celebrities who deserve the Walk of Fame more than Tinker Bell&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clint Eastwood]],&lt;ref name=&quot;UPITen&quot;/&gt; have declined to participate; nominations cannot proceed without the nominee's consent. Others, such as [[George Clooney]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/ask-stargirl &quot;Dear Stargirl: Hollywood's Stargirl has the answers&quot;] Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. Retrieved 2010-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Denver]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Conklin&quot;/&gt; were nominated but would not agree to the mandatory personal appearance at the unveiling ceremony. Others have simply never been nominated, or do not have a nominator willing or able to pay the selection fee, or have less than the required five years' minimum involvement in their designated field. Others are merely victims of selection constraints and probability: only about 10% of nominees are selected each year.

A fee (currently $30,000), payable at time of selection, is collected to pay for the creation and installation of the star, as well as general maintenance of the Walk of Fame. The fee is usually paid by the nominating organization, which may be a fan club, or a film studio, record company, broadcaster, or other sponsor involved with the honoree's current or ongoing project.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson-Evans, Catherine (December 3, 2003).

It was unveiled in March 2010, shortly before Hopper's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duke, Alan (March 26, 2010).

Traditionally, the identities of selection committee members, other than its chairman, have not been made public in order to minimize conflicts of interest and to discourage lobbying by celebrities and their representatives (a significant problem during the original selections in the late 1950s). However, in 1999, in response to intensifying charges of &quot;back room politics&quot; in the selection process, the Chamber disclosed the members' names: They were Johnny Grant, the longtime chair and representative of the television category; [[Earl Lestz]], president of [[Paramount Studios|Paramount Studio Group]] (motion pictures); Stan Spero, retired manager with broadcast stations [[KMPC]] and [[KABC (AM)|KABC]] (radio); Kate Nelson, owner of the [[Avalon Hollywood|Palace Theatre]] (live performance); and Mary Lou Dudas, vice president of [[A&amp;M Records]] (recording industry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=January 6, 1999|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/06/local/me-60983|title=Hollywood Tries to Help Stars Shine|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, however, the Chamber has revealed only that Lestz (who received his own star in 2004) became chairman after Grant died in 2008. Their current official position is that &quot;each of the five categories is represented by someone with expertise in that field.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WOFFAQ&quot;/&gt;

As of June 2010, Lestz had been replaced as chairman by John Pavlik, former Director of Communications for the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos.presslist.oscars.org/listanevent.php?events=781 &quot;Academy Appoints Unger Communications Chief&quot;].

'''Hollywood Records''' is an [[United States|American]] [[record label]] owned by [[Disney Music Group]], a subsidiary of [[the Walt Disney Company]].

==History==
Hollywood Records was founded in 1989 by then-Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] with the idea of expanding the music operations of the company (then reduced to the release of the soundtracks of Disney, Touchstone, and Hollywood Pictures films) and to develop and promote the careers of a wide variety of artists in various genres. However, the label struggled to launch a successful artist, and in 1991 the label had significant financial loss. The only major success was the agreement to be the catalog distributors of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], a fact affected by the death of vocalist [[Freddie Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/27/business/the-media-business-memo-cites-disney-records-woes.html?scp=1&amp;sq=hollywood%20records&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Memo Cites Disney Records' Woes | date=27 November 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Label problems continued and even years after the acquisition of [[Mammoth Records]] in 1997 was seen as a sign of the search by Disney for a record label that would give success to the company. However, Mammoth Records was dissolved and integrated into the label in 2003, after little success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/28/business/the-corporate-wooing-and-winning-of-mammoth-records.html?scp=3&amp;sq=hollywood%20records&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Trip | last=Gabriel | title=The Corporate Wooing and Winning of Mammoth Records | date=28 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the company decided to integrate the operations of [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]] with Hollywood, [[Lyric Street Records|Lyric Street]], and Mammoth, with Walt Disney Music Publishing, creating Buena Vista Music Group (now [[Disney Music Group]]) and appointing Bob Cavallo as chairman of the group, and president of Hollywood Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50B14F73F5D0C718DDDA80894D0494D81&amp;scp=7&amp;sq=bob%20cavallo&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Regrouping, Disney Music Names Chairman | date=12 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 2003, with the launch of [[Hilary Duff]]'s musical career that the label would be a real success. The album sold more than 5 million copies and was the beginning of a successful business model for the label, with a total synergy with Disney Channel and Radio Disney, which would bring its artists to have strong media exposure. Duff was the best artist of the successive record with 13 million copies sold. Artists such as [[the Cheetah Girls]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]], [[Raven-Symoné]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Zoë Bielen]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Selena Gomez &amp; The Scene]], and the [[Jonas Brothers]] replicate this model of marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E4DF143EF93BA35751C0A9609C8B63&amp;scp=5&amp;sq=bob%20cavallo&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Ben | last=Sisario | title=A Musical For Tweens Captures Its Audience | date=8 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the label continues to develop the careers of artists with a profile less commercial like [[Grace Potter &amp; The Nocturnals]]. The label also releases soundtracks from [[Touchstone Pictures]] films.  In 2010, Hollywood absorbed Disney's country music label, Lyric Street Records, subsequently inheriting its roster of acts. In 2011, Queen's music was distributed by Universal worldwide, as outside the US, Queen left [[EMI]] for Universal-owned [[Island Records]].

==Hollywood BASIC==
[[Image:Hollywood BASIC.jpg|right]]
'''Hollywood BASIC''' [''[[sic]]''] was Hollywood’s short-lived hip-hop subsidiary, run by Dave Funkenklein, which existed from 1990 to 1995.&lt;ref&gt;http://rateyourmusic.com/label/hollywood_basic&lt;/ref&gt; It did not survive the distribution transition its parent made to PolyGram Records, and all of its recordings were deleted, save for those by [[Organized Konfusion]], which were repressed under the new deal. It was the first label to record [[DJ Shadow]], releasing his &quot;Lesson 4&quot; (a reference to [[Double Dee and Steinski]]) as the B-side of a 1991 single by [[Lifers' Group]], a hip hop group composed of convicts serving sentences at [[Rahway Prison]] in New Jersey. It also released Shadow's Legitimate Mix on the B-side of a single by the group [[Zimbabwe Legit]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]], ''Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', 2nd ed. London: Rough Guides/Penguin Books, 2000 (p. 102).&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable releases came from [[Organized Konfusion]]; its challenging second album, ''[[Stress: The Extinction Agenda]]'' (1994), was widely acclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Shapiro, ''Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', 2nd ed. London: Rough Guides/Penguin Books, 2000 (p. 291).&lt;/ref&gt; The label was also home of [[Charizma|Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf]], although, following the shooting death of Charizma in 1993, the music the duo recorded for the label was not released. This would later inspire [[Peanut Butter Wolf]] to found [[Stones Throw Records]] in order to make this music available.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Shapiro, ''Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', 2nd ed. London: Rough Guides/Penguin Books, 2000 (pp. 349–351).&lt;/ref&gt; Acts on Hollywood BASIC's roster included Charizma and [[Peanut Butter Wolf]], Lifers' Group, [[Organized Konfusion]], [[Raw Fusion]], and Zimbabwe Legit.

==Hollywood METAL==
'''Hollywood METAL''' was a short-lived label within Hollywood Records that was to be focused on rock and heavy-metal music. Other than promotional appearances by Hollywood Records artists, there were no releases.&lt;ref&gt;http://unheard78.blogspot.com/2011/03/hollywood-basic-basic-beats-sampler.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Upon its 1989 launch, Hollywood was distributed by [[Elektra Records]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Distribution in North America switched to [[PolyGram]] (now [[Universal Music Group]]) in [[1995 in music|1995]].  Today, Universal Music Group markets and distributes Hollywood Records catalog in [[North America]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[South America]], [[México]] and [[India]]; while [[Avex]] markets and distributes Hollywood Records catalog in [[Japan]]. Also, several Hollywood artists including [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Jonas Brothers]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Selena Gomez &amp; The Scene]],Nick Jonas &amp; The Administration , Joe Jonas , Connect 3 and Annel Cereceres are directly signed to Universal Music UK's [[Fascination Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=UNIVERSAL MUSIC, DISNEY MUSIC FORGE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND: Forthcoming Releases Include Jonas Brothers and Hannah Montana|url=http://new.umusic.com/News.aspx?NewsId=738|publisher=[[Universal Music Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other territories [[EMI Music]], Disney's partner in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], distributes the label. There were reports in 2011 that Disney Music Group would start a US distrubition arm for it's labels releases, but as of Feberuary 2012 these plans have not yet been acted upon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2900">[[Image:Hollywood gpu.png|thumb|right|150px|ATI &quot;Hollywood&quot; GPU within the Wii console]]

'''Hollywood''' is the name of the [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) used in [[Nintendo|Nintendo's]] [[Wii]] [[video game console]]. It was designed by [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD's]] graphics product division, [[ATI Technologies|ATI]], and is manufactured using the same [[90 nm]] CMOS process&lt;ref name=&quot;hard_japan&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}}{{cite web| url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/e3_2006/wii/index.html| title=Wiiの概要 (Wii本体)| publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[Broadway (microprocessor)|&quot;Broadway&quot;]] processor. Very few official details were released to the public by Nintendo, ATI, or [[IBM]]. The Hollywood GPU is reportedly based on the Nintendo GameCube's &quot;Flipper&quot; GPU and is clocked 50% higher at 243&amp;nbsp;MHz,&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNTech&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=IGN: Revolution's Horsepower|date=2006-03-29|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2006-12-23|url= http://wii.ign.com/articles/699/699118p1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; though none of the [[clock rate]]s have been confirmed by Nintendo, IBM, or ATI.

GPU is fixed function only.

The Hollywood is a [[multi-chip module]] (MCM) package containing two [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]]s under the cover. One of the two chips, codenamed ''Napa'', controls the I/O functions, [[Random-access memory|RAM]] access, and the actual GPU with its embedded [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]], and measures 8 × 9&amp;nbsp;mm. The other, codenamed ''Vegas'', holds the Audio [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] and the 24 MB of &quot;internal&quot; [[1T-SRAM]] and measures 13.5 × 7&amp;nbsp;mm.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The Hollywood also contains an [[ARM architecture|ARM926]] core, which has been unofficially nicknamed the ''Starlet''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiibrew&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Starlet|url=http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Starlet|work=Wiibrew|accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This embedded microprocessor performs many of the I/O functions, including controlling the wireless functionality, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], the optical disc drive, and other miscellaneous functions. It also acts as the security controller of the system, performing encryption and authentication functions. The Hollywood includes hardware implementations of [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] and [[SHA-1]], to speed up these functions. Communication with the main CPU is accomplished via an [[Inter-process communication|IPC]] mechanism. The Starlet performs the [[WiiConnect24]] functions while the Wii console is in standby mode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiibrew&quot;/&gt;

The '''Hollywood District''' (originally Hollyrood, after the Scottish [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]]) is a neighborhood of northeast [[Portland, Oregon]], United States renamed for its historic 1920s-era [[Hollywood Theatre (Portland, Oregon)|Hollywood Theatre]].  Although a mixed commercial and residential area, it serves primarily as a shopping district to the adjacent neighborhoods of [[Grant Park, Portland, Oregon|Grant Park]] and [[Laurelhurst, Portland, Oregon|Laurelhurst]], as well as to riders of the [[MAX Light Rail]] System.  The Hollywood District also figures in [[Beverly Cleary]]'s Klickitat Street series of books, a fact memorialized in a display at the neighborhood library.  Details on a Beverly Cleary walking tour are available at the library.

The Hollywood District was originally part of the Rose City Park subdivision which was [[plat]]ted in 1907.  The original Rose City Park subdivision was part of the [[Donation Land Claim Act|Donation Land Claim]] of Joseph Backenstos.  The land was later assigned to his widow by President [[Andrew Johnson]] in 1866. 1890s-era maps refer to the area as the Crook Tract.

[[Image:Hollywood Theater - Portland Oregon.jpg|thumb|left|Hollywood Theatre]]
The Hollywood District is home to the Hollywood Farmers Market, a seasonal [[farmers' market]] located on northeast Hancock between 44th and 45th avenues that runs from May through November.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodfarmersmarket.org&lt;/ref&gt; The Hollywood Boosters started &quot;Hollywood at Night&quot; in summer of 2006.  This is a monthly neighborhood event that takes place on the third Thursday of every month to bring together residents and local businesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3530">'''Hollywood ''' is an [[unincorporated community]] located within [[St. Mary's County, Maryland|St. Mary's County]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|594751}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named in 1867, when a storeowner at Thompson's General Store near the Uniontown section of Hollywood required a name for the post office inside the store. The storeowner was inspired by the gigantic [[holly]] tree planted in front of the store and named the post office Hollywood. 

==History==
Hollywood is home to distinctive landmarks such as the congregation of St. John Francis Regis Catholic Church, which was founded in 1690. The area also includes the nationally renowned [[Sotterley (Hollywood, Maryland)|Sotterley Plantation]] on the banks of the [[Patuxent River]]. Sotterley was founded in 1703 by [[James Bowles]], a wealthy planter, eventually changing hands to former Maryland Governor [[George Plater]] and through the 20th century to [[Louisa Satterlee]] and her husband. She was the daughter of [[J.P. Morgan]]. The town is also home to a recently demolished manor house, [[Resurrection Manor]], which was thought to have been built in 1640 by [[Thomas Cornwalleys]], the grandfather of the General [[Lord Cornwallis]] who surrendered to [[George Washington]] at the [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Battle of Yorktown]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].

==Economy==
The contemporary community of Hollywood now serves as a small rural community with extensive farms that produce [[soybean]], [[corn]], [[hay]], [[grain]]s, [[wheat]]s, and formerly tobacco. It currently hosts an industrial park where corporations such as [[Northrop Grumman]] have branch offices. There is a training/conference center for engineers attached to the nearby [[Patuxent River Naval Air Station]]. Numerous roads lead to the shore of the [[Patuxent River]]. Hollywood is not an incorporated town, residing under the direct authority of the St. Mary's County Commissioners.

==Schools==
Hollywood is home to Hollywood Elementary School[http://www.smcps.k12.md.us/schools/elem/hes/index-hes.htm] on Joy Chapel Road, which is divided into multiple &quot;houses&quot; that each emphasize a different culture from around the world.
Hollywood is also the home of St. John Regis Catholic School. St. John's School was opened on September 12, 1923 under the leadership of Rev. Joseph M. Johnson, S.J. The first four grades were taught in the sacristy of the church and grades five through eight were held in a second story room over the sacristy. 

From the 1920s until the 1980s, the school was staffed by the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, Kentucky. On May 20, 1924 the white frame section of the school was completed as a four-room school building. On June 15, 1952 a brick addition of two classrooms, auditorium and full basement were completed. Later, part of the auditorium was partitioned to make two additional classrooms and the remaining auditorium space was converted to a library.

==Socks the cat==
[[Socks (cat)|Socks]], the cat of President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], lived in Hollywood after the Clintons left the White House in 2001. Socks, who lived with Bill Clinton's secretary [[Betty Currie]], was euthanized in 2009.

'''Hollywood''', historically known as '''Killinkeyvin'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logainm.ie/?text=hollywood&amp;placeID=2694 Placenames Database of Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Irish place name|Cillín Chaoimhín|Kevin's little church}}), is a village in west [[County Wicklow]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is situated on the [[R756 road|Wicklow Gap]] road, near its junction with the [[N81 road (Ireland)|N81]] [[national secondary road]]. A population of less the 100 people registered in the [[List of towns in the Republic of Ireland/2002 Census Records|2002 Census]], though the community draws from a larger area which consists of about 500 people.

== Etymology ==
''Cillín Chaoimhín'' is the associated Irish name for Hollywood; its literal translation being Kevin's Small Church. Another, older Irish name is ''Cnoic Rua'', literally meaning ''Red Hill''. This may be a reference to the red berries of holly trees on the hills above the village or it may in fact be a reference to the presence of Wicklow heather. Another possibility is that the original name for Hollywood may have been Holy Wood, as a reference to Saint Kevin's passage through.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

[[Image:IMG OldVillageHollywood4971wretouched.jpg|thumb|right|Tutty's of Hollywood.]]
== History ==
The village has a long association with 6th Century [[Kevin of Glendalough|Saint Kevin]] and many pilgrims passed through, following in Saint Kevin's footsteps, on their way to the [[monastic settlement]] at [[Glendalough]], until the practice ceased in the early 1900s. Local landmarks include Saint Kevin's Chair,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithomania.com/show/site/35 Saint Kevin's Chair]&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint Kevin's Cave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wicklownationalpark.ie/pages/park_kevinsbed_web.php Saint Kevin's Bed or Cave]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Kevin's Way]] is a 30&amp;nbsp;km pilgrim path from Hollywood to [[Glendalough]], and it is the good way to enjoy part of the [[Wicklow Mountains National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/recreation/heritage-council-initiatives/the-pilgrim-paths/st-kevins-way/?L=0 St Kevin’s Way, Co. Wicklow] on the Heritage Council website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surroundings ==
The [[Church of Ireland]] in the village church has a vaulted roof from the 17th century. About 3&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the village is the picturesque [[Poulaphouca]], where the [[Liffey]] cascades in three stages. The [[Poulaphouca Reservoir]] (also known as ''Blessington Lakes''), which cover about {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} or 20&amp;nbsp;km², were formed 50 years ago by the building of the Poulaphouca Dam and [[hydroelectric]] power station, and today serve the purpose of providing the power and water that supply [[County Dublin]].

The [[Bronze Age]] Piper's Stones, are 3.5&amp;nbsp;km to the southwest of Hollywood on the N81.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithomania.com/show/site/1600 The Piper's Stones]&lt;/ref&gt; The site is signposted.

Hollywood, like its [[Hollywood|namesake]] in [[California]], has an illustrious past in the entertainment industry. It has provided the picturesque setting for some of the filming of several movies, including [[King Arthur (film)|King Arthur]], Dancing At Lughnasa, and [[Michael Collins (film)|Michael Collins]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

== Sports ==
[[Gaelic games]] play a strong role in the community, the local club being [[Hollywood GAA]] club who play in the [[Wicklow Senior Football Championship]].

&quot;'''Hollywood'''&quot; is a song by  American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. The song was written and produced by Madonna and [[Mirwais Ahmadzaï]] for her ninth studio album, ''[[American Life]]'' (2003). It was released as the second single from the album on July 14, 2003 by [[Maverick Records]]. &quot;Hollywood&quot; is a [[folk rock]] song that lyrically refers and criticizes the life style of district [[Hollywood]]. It received mixed reviews from music critics, who considered the song as catchy, despite criticizing its lyrical content. &quot;Hollywood&quot; attained moderate success, reaching number two in the [[United Kingdom]], while making into the top ten of in [[Canada]], [[Finland]], and [[Italy]]. In the United States, the song failed to enter on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Madonna's first single since 1982's &quot;[[Burning Up]]&quot; to do so. 

An accompanying music video, directed by [[Jean-Baptiste Mondino]], portrays Madonna in different styles and fashions highlighting the highs and lows of Hollywood. &quot;Hollywood&quot; was first performed in an acoustic version along with &quot;American Life&quot; and &quot;Mother and Father&quot; on the 2003 American Life Promo Tour. On August 27, 2003, Madonna opened the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]] performing a medley of &quot;[[Like a Virgin]]/Hollywood&quot; with [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Missy Elliott]]. During the performance, Madonna kissed Spears and Aguilera on the lips, scene that generated strong reaction from the media. The song was later used as a dancers interlude on the 2004 [[Re-Invention World Tour]].

==Background==
''American Life'' became Madonna's final studio album with [[Maverick Records]], and marked the end of an eleven-year recording history with the label.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2004/jun/16/citynews.arts |title=Madonna ends her Maverick era |last=Teather |first=David |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=2004-06-16 |accessdate=2010-02-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=103495&amp;page=1 |title=Heads Roll at Madonna's Maverick Label |last= |first= |work=[[ABC News]] |publisher=ABC News/Entertainment |date=2004-07-20 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[VH1]] Madonna discussed her motivations behind the record discussing her 20 years in the industry and stating that &quot;material things&quot; were unimportant and she also stated, &quot;I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that a lot of things that I'd valued weren't important&quot; in response to the non-materialistic themes of the record.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/madonna-speaks-for-the-first-time-to-vh1-on-new-american-life-album-and-video-in-half-hour-special-followed-by-us-premiere-of-a-performance-only-version-of-the-new-american-life-video-70870767.html|title='Madonna Speaks' For The First Time To VH1 On New 'American Life' Album and Video in Half-Hour Special, Followed By U.S. Premiere of a Performance Only Version of the New 'American Life' Video|date=2003-04-14|accessdate=2011-09-25|publisher=PR Newswire. United Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter illegal Internet downloads of the album's songs both before and after the album's release, Madonna's associates created a number of false song files of similar length and size. Some of these files delivered a brief message from Madonna saying &quot;What the fuck do you think you're doing?&quot; followed by minutes of silence.&lt;ref name=&quot;regi&quot;/&gt; Madonna's website hacker add a message appearing on the Main Page, saying &quot;This is what the fuck I think I'm doing...&quot; followed by download links for each of the album's songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;regi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/22/like_a_virgin_madonna_hacked/|date=2003-04-22|accessdate=2010-04-07 |title=Like a virgin – Madonna hacked for the very first time |work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was closed after the attack for about 15 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;regi&quot;/&gt;

The album has been deemed by some as a [[concept album]] featuring political themes based around the United States. Whilst talking to MTV she discussed the political themes within the record saying; &quot;I feel like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame just for the sake of fame, no matter what — sell your soul to the devil if that's what it takes. And we're also completely obsessed with the way we look. And I bought into a lot of that, so a lot of the record, especially the first three songs [American Life, Hollywood, I'm So Stupid] are just like, &quot;What was I thinking?&quot;&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ame song&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/madonna/news_feature_042203/ |first=John|last= Norris|publisher=MTV News.

Several remixes of &quot;Hollywood&quot; done by DJs such as [[Stuart Price|Jacques Lu Cont]], [[The Micronauts]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], [[Deepsky]] and [[Victor Calderone]], were included on physical releases of the single around the world.&lt;ref name=ausmaxi/&gt; In August 2003, the song was remixed with &quot;[[Into the Groove]]&quot; and performed with [[Missy Elliott]] under the title &quot;Into the Hollywood Groove&quot; as part of a promotional campaign for clothing retailer [[Gap (clothing retailer)|GAP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0808/p19s01-almp.html|title=Sellout or smart marketing?|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=2003-08-08|accessdate=2011-09-25|last=Margolis|first=Lynne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the promotional CD were given away to customers, and were not available for individual purchase.&lt;ref name=gapcd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/07/25/BU267694.DTL|title=Bands to fit the brand|last=Strasburg|first=Jenny|date=2003-07-25|accessdate=2011-09-25|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=Frank J.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Hollywood&quot; received mixed reviews from [[music critics]]. Alexis Petridis of ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted &quot;Madonna exclusively divulges [in the song] that not everyone who wants to make it in the movies succeeds.&quot;&lt;ref name=theguardian/&gt; Michael Hubbard of [[musicOMH]] commented &quot;it would be even better if the lazy lyrics (where just about everything rhymes with &quot;Hollywood&quot; – especially itself) had been dispensed with.&quot;&lt;ref name=musicomh/&gt; He also added that &quot;it has the name Madonna on it so it will sell, but it's hardly vintage stuff. Time for some musical reinvention to go with the incessant changes of image.&quot;&lt;ref name=musicomh/&gt; Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] thought &quot;following up 'American Life' with 'Hollywood' was nearly as ballsy&quot; due to its lyrical content.&lt;ref name=slant/&gt; Jude Adam of ''[[Third Way Magazine]]'' gave the song a positive review, considering it as &quot;quirky, sunny, and sweet in perfect mesures,&quot; adding that &quot;Hollywood&quot; is &quot;the kind of pop tune that instantly transports you to California, driving along Santa Monica Boulevard with the roof down.&quot;&lt;ref name=thirdwaymagazine&gt;{{cite journal |author= |year=2003 |title=Reviews: Madonna: American Life |journal=Third Way Magazine |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=32 |publisher=Hymns Ancient &amp; Modern Ltd |issn=0006-2510 |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=j_GQYNRYTjcC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=madonna+-+hollywood+%2B+single#v=onepage&amp;q=madonna%20-%20hollywood%20%2B%20single&amp;f=false |accessdate= 2011-09-25 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Thompson of ''[[The A.V.

===Chart performance===
&quot;Hollywood&quot; failed to enter the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the [[United States]], or the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]] chart. It was the first time since 1982's &quot;[[Burning Up]]&quot; that a Madonna single did not appear on either chart.

==Music video==
[[File:hollywoodmusicvideo.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Madonna in the &quot;Hollywood&quot; video.]]
The [[music video]] for &quot;Hollywood&quot; was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] and directed by [[Jean-Baptiste Mondino]], who previously worked with Madonna on her videos for &quot;[[Justify My Love]]&quot; (1990), &quot;[[Human Nature (Madonna song)|Human Nature]]&quot; (1995), &quot;[[Love Don't Live Here Anymore]]&quot; (1996), and &quot;[[Don't Tell Me (Madonna song)|Don't Tell Me]]&quot; (2000). In the US, it premiered on June 23, 2003 on [[VH1]] (along with a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the video), June 24 on [[Yahoo!|yahoo.com]] and June 27 on [[MTV]]. Two official remix videos of &quot;Hollywood&quot; were also released. The &quot;Aviddiva Remix&quot; created by Dustin Robertson featured unreleased footage from the video shoot. The second remix video entitled the &quot;Paul Oakenfold Edit&quot; was released by [[Warner Bros. Records]] as a promo-only and consisted mostly of clips from the original video. The video features Madonna in different styles and fashions highlighting the highs and lows of &quot;Hollywood&quot;.

===Lawsuit===
After the release of the music video for Hollywood, the son of French fashion photographer Guy Bourdin filed a federal lawsuit that accused Madonna of ripping off the work of his acclaimed father. The copyright lawsuit against Madonna, claimed that her video for the song &quot;Hollywood&quot; was a blatant visual theft job of his father's iconic images. &quot;It's one thing to draw inspiration; it's quite another to simply plagiarize the heart and soul of my father's work,&quot; Bourdin said at the time. Included in Bourdin's federal complaint were side-by-side comparisons of his father's work with images with stills from the &quot;Hollywood&quot; video. Details of the financial settlement are confidential and Madonna acknowledged no wrongdoing in her liberal appropriation of the images  Bourdin's lawyer, John Koegel, said the parties reached a &quot;very, very successful settlement,&quot; adding that terms of the deal did not allow him to discuss exact dollar amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/madonna-accused-picture-piracy|title=Madonna Accused Of Picture Piracy|date=2003-09-30|publisher=The Smoking Gun|accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Film|cinema]] of the [[United States]]''', also known as '''Hollywood''', has had a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early 20th century. Its history is sometimes separated into four main periods: the [[silent film|silent film era]], [[classical Hollywood cinema]], [[New Hollywood]], and the contemporary period. While the [[Lumiere Brothers]] are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema, it is undisputably American cinema that soon became the most dominant force in an emerging industry. Since the 1920s, the American film industry has grossed more money every year than that of any other country. 

In 1878, [[Eadweard Muybridge]] demonstrated the power of [[photography]] to capture motion. In 1894, the world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in [[New York City]], using [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Kinetoscope]]. The United States was in the forefront of [[sound film]] development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around [[Hollywood]], [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. [[Picture City, Florida|Picture City]], FL was also a planned site for a movie picture production center in the 1920s, but due to the [[1928 Okeechobee hurricane]], the idea collapsed and [[Picture City, Florida|Picture City]] returned to its original name of [[Hobe Sound, Florida|Hobe Sound]]. Director [[D. W. Griffith]] was central to the development of [[film grammar]]. [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) is frequently cited in critics' polls as the greatest film of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/villvoice.html ''Village Voice'': 100 Best Films of the 20th century (2001)].

Retrieved on June 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; American screen actors like [[John Wayne]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] have become iconic figures, while producer/entrepreneur [[Walt Disney]] was a leader in both [[Animation|animated film]] and movie [[merchandising]]. The [[major film studio]]s of Hollywood are the primary source of the most commercially successful movies in the world, such as ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' (1977), ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009). Today, American film studios collectively generate several hundred movies every year, making the United States the third most prolific producer of films in the world — the first being [[Cinema of India|India]] and the second being [[Cinema of Nigeria|Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/nigerias-nollywood-eclipsing-hollywood-in-africa-1974087.html |title=Nigeria's Nollywood eclipsing Hollywood in Africa |date=2010-05-15 |publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
The second recorded instance of David capturing and reproducing motion was [[David at a Gallop|a series of photographs of a running horse]] by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], which he captured in [[Palo Alto, California]], using a set of still cameras placed in a row. Muybridge's accomplishment led inventors everywhere to attempt to make similar devices that would capture such motion. In the United States, [[Thomas Edison]] was among the first to produce such a device, the ''[[kinetoscope]]'', whose heavy-handed patent enforcement caused early filmmakers to look for alternatives.

In the earliest days of the American film industry, [[New York]] played a role. The [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in [[Queens]], built during the silent film era, was used by the [[Marx Brothers]] and [[W.C. Fields]]. [[Chelsea, Manhattan]] was also frequently used. [[Mary Pickford]], an [[Academy Award]] winning actress, shot some of her early films in this area. Other major centers of film production also included [[Chicago]], [[Florida]], [[California]], and [[Cuba]].

The film patents wars of the early 20th century led to the spread of film companies across the U.S. Many worked with equipment for which they did not own the rights, and thus filming in New York could be dangerous; it was close to Edison's Company headquarters, and to agents the company set out to seize cameras. By 1912, most major film companies had set up production facilities in [[Southern California]] near or in [[Los Angeles]] because of the location's proximity to [[Mexico]], as well as the region's favorable year-round weather.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Lewis; Rise of the American film, The; Harcourt Brace, New York, 1930; p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of Hollywood===
{{Americanfilmlist}}
In early 1910, director [[D.W. Griffith]] was sent by the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph Company]] to the west coast with his acting troupe, consisting of actors [[Blanche Sweet]], [[Lillian Gish]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], and others. They started filming on a vacant lot near Georgia Street in downtown [[Los Angeles]]. While there, the company decided to explore new territories, traveling several miles north to [[Hollywood]], a little village that was friendly and enjoyed the movie company filming there. Griffith then filmed the first movie ever shot in Hollywood, ''[[In Old California (1910 film)|In Old California]]'', a Biograph melodrama about [[California]] in the 19th century, when it belonged to Mexico. Biograph stayed there for months and made several films before returning to New York. After hearing about Biograph's success in Hollywood, in 1913 many movie-makers headed west to avoid the fees imposed by [[Thomas Edison]], who owned patents on the movie-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pederson|first=Charles E.|title=Thomas Edison|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HGnmX5WR2BAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=September 2007|publisher=Abdo Publishing Company|isbn=1599288451|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Los Angeles, California]], the [[List of Hollywood movie studios|studios]] and [[Hollywood]] grew. Before [[World War I]], movies were made in several U.S. cities, but filmmakers gravitated to [[southern California]] as the industry developed. They were attracted by the mild climate and reliable sunlight, which made it possible to film movies outdoors year-round, and by the varied scenery that was available. There are several starting points for cinema (particularly American cinema), but it was Griffith's controversial 1915 epic ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'' that pioneered the worldwide filming vocabulary that still dominates celluloid to this day.

In the early 20th century, when the medium was new, many [[Jew]]ish immigrants found employment in the U.S. film industry. They were able to make their mark in a brand-new business: the exhibition of short films in storefront theaters called [[Nickelodeon movie theater|nickelodeons]], after their admission price of a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]] (five cents). Within a few years, ambitious men like [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[William Fox]], [[Carl Laemmle]], [[Adolph Zukor]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], and the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] (Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack) had switched to the production side of the business. Soon they were the heads of a new kind of enterprise: the [[movie studio]]. (It is worth noting that the US had at least one female director, producer and studio head in these early years, [[Alice Guy-Blaché]].) They also set the stage for the industry's internationalism; the industry is often accused of Amero-centric provincialism.

Other moviemakers arrived from Europe after World War I: directors like [[Ernst Lubitsch]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Fritz Lang]], and [[Jean Renoir]]; and actors like [[Rudolph Valentino]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Ronald Colman]], and [[Charles Boyer]]. They joined a homegrown supply of actors&amp;nbsp;— lured west from the New York City stage after the introduction of sound films&amp;nbsp;— to form one of the 20th century's most remarkable growth industries. At motion pictures' height of popularity in the mid-1940s, the studios were cranking out a total of about 400 movies a year, seen by an audience of 90 million Americans per week [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-52148/history-of-the-motion-picture#508075.hook].

Sound also became widely used in Hollywood in the late 1920s [http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/motionpicture1.html]. After ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'', the first film with synchronized voices, was successfully released as a Vitaphone talkie in 1927, Hollywood film companies would respond to Warner Bros. and begin to use Vitaphone sound&amp;nbsp;— which Warner Bros. owned until 1928 - in future films. By May 1928, Electrical Research Product Incorporated (ERPI), a subsidiary of the Western Electric company, gained a monopoly over film sound distribution [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-52148/history-of-the-motion-picture#508075.hook]. A side effect of the &quot;talkies&quot; was that many actors who had made their careers in silent films suddenly found themselves out of work, as they often had bad voices or could not remember their lines. Meanwhile, in 1922, US politician [[Will H. Hays]] left politics and formed the movie studio boss organization known as the Motion Pictures Distributors Association of America (MPDAA)
[http://lcweb2.loc.gov:8081/ammem/amrlhtml/dthays.html]. The organization became the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] after Hays retired in 1945.

In the early times of [[talkie]]s, American studios found that their sound productions were rejected in foreign-language markets and even among speakers of other dialects of English. The [[lip sync|synchronization]] technology was still too primitive for [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]]. One of the solutions was creating parallel foreign-language versions of Hollywood films. Around 1930, the American companies &lt;!-- which? --&gt; opened a studio in [[Joinville-le-Pont]], France, where the same sets and wardrobe and even mass scenes were used for different [[time-sharing]] crews. Also, foreign unemployed actors, playwrights and winners of [[photogenia]] contests were chosen and brought to Hollywood, where they shot parallel versions of the English-language films. These parallel versions had a lower budget, were shot at night and were directed by second-line American directors who did not speak the foreign language. The Spanish-language crews included people like [[Luis Buñuel]], [[Enrique Jardiel Poncela]], [[Xavier Cugat]] and [[Edgar Neville]]. The productions were not very successful in their intended markets, due to the following reasons:
*The lower budgets were apparent.
*Many theater actors had no previous experience in cinema.
*The original movies were often second-rate themselves, since studios expected that the top productions would sell by themselves.
*The mix of foreign accents (Castilian, Mexican, and Chilean for example in the Spanish case) was odd for the audiences.
*Some markets lacked sound-equipped theaters.
In spite of this, some productions like the Spanish version of [[Dracula (1931 film)|Dracula]] compare favorably with the original. By the mid-1930s, synchronization had advanced enough for dubbing to become usual.

During the so-called [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Hollywood]], which lasted from the end of the silent era in American cinema in the late 1920s to the early 1960s, thousands of movies were issued from the Hollywood studios. The start of the Golden Age was arguably when ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' was released in 1927, ending the silent era and increasing box-office profits for films as sound was introduced to feature films. Most Hollywood pictures adhered closely to a formula - [[Western (genre)|Western]], [[slapstick comedy]], [[musical film|musical]], [[animated cartoon]], [[biopic]] (biographical picture) - and the same creative teams often worked on films made by the same studio. For example, [[Cedric Gibbons]] and [[Herbert Stothart]] always worked on [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] films, [[Alfred Newman]] worked at [[20th Century Fox]] for twenty years, [[Cecil B. De Mille]]'s films were almost all made at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], and director [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]]'s films were mostly made for [[20th Century Fox]]. 

At the same time, one could usually guess which studio made which film, largely because of the actors who appeared in it;  [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], for example, claimed it had contracted &quot;more stars than there are in heaven.&quot; Each studio had its own style and characteristic touches which made it possible to know this&amp;nbsp;— a trait that does not exist today.  For example, ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' (1944) is famous not only for the first pairing of actors [[Humphrey Bogart]] (1899–1957) and [[Lauren Bacall]] (1924–) but also for being written by two future winners of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]: [[Ernest Hemingway]] (1899–1961), the author of the novel on which the script was nominally based, and [[William Faulkner]] (1897–1962), who worked on the screen adaptation.

After ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' was released in 1927, [[Warner Bros.]] gained huge success and were able to acquire their own string of movie theaters, after purchasing [http://www.google.com/search?as_epq=Stanley+Theaters&amp;hl=en&amp;num=100&amp;safe=off Stanley Theaters] and [[First National|First National Productions]] in 1928. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] had also owned the [[Loews Theaters|Loews]] string of theaters since forming in 1924, and the Fox Film Corporation owned the [[Fox Theatres|Fox Theatre]] strings as well. Also, [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] (a 1928 merger between [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum|Keith-Orpheum Theaters]] and the [[RCA|Radio Corporation of America]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.earthlink.net/~hdtv/History/RKOGeneral/RKOPictures.html Thumbnail History of RKO Radio Pictures]&lt;/ref&gt;) responded to the Western Electric/ERPI monopoly over sound in films, and developed their own method, known as [[Photophone]], to put sound in films [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-52148/history-of-the-motion-picture#508075.hook]. Paramount, which already acquired Balaban and Katz in 1926, would answer to the success of Warner Bros. and RKO, and buy a number of theaters in the late 1920s as well, and would hold a monopoly on theaters in [[Detroit, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/united-detroit_paramount-history.htm The Paramount Theater Monoply&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, all of America's theaters were owned by the Big Five studios - [[MGM]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[RKO]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[20th Century Fox]]. [http://www.filmsite.org/20sintro.html].

Movie-making was still a business however, and motion picture companies made money by operating under the [[studio system]]. The major studios kept thousands of people on salary&amp;nbsp;— actors, producers, directors, writers, stunt men, craftspersons, and technicians. They owned or leased [[Movie ranches|Movie Ranches]] in rural Southern California for [[location shooting]] of [[Western (genre)|westerns]] and other large scale genre films.  And they owned hundreds of theaters in cities and towns across the nation, theaters that showed their films and that were always in need of fresh material. 

In 1930, MPDAA President Will Hays created the [[Hays Code|Hays (Production) Code]], which followed censorship guidelines and went into effect after government threats of censorship expanded by 1930 [http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=tdihArticleCategory&amp;id=3125]. However, the code was never enforced until 1934, after the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] watchdog organization [[National Legion of Decency|The Legion of Decency]] - appalled by some of the provocative films and lurid advertising of the era later classified [[Pre-Code Hollywood]]- threatened a boycott of motion pictures if it didn't go into effect [http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/29/pre_code_cinema/]. Those films that didn't obtain a seal of approval from the Production Code Administration had to pay a $25,000.00 fine and could not profit in the theaters, as the MPDAA owned every theater in the country through the Big Five studios [http://web.archive.org/web/20091026204028/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Lot/4344/stage2.html ].

Throughout the 1930s, as well as most of the golden age, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] dominated the film screen and had the top stars in Hollywood, and was also credited for creating the Hollywood star system altogether [http://mgm.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=40&amp;cat=6]. Some [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] stars included &quot;King of Hollywood&quot; [[Clark Gable]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Jeanette MacDonald]] and husband [[Gene Raymond]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Gene Kelly]] [http://mgm.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=40&amp;cat=6]. But MGM did not stand alone. Another great achievement of US cinema during this era came through [[Walt Disney|Walt Disney's]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|animation company]]. In 1937, Disney created the most successful film of its time, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' [http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/movies/snow/snow.html]. This distinction was promptly topped in 1939 when Selznick International created what is still, when adjusted for inflation, the most successful film of all time, ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' [http://www.boxofficereport.com/atbon/adjusted.shtml]. 

Many film historians have remarked upon the many great works of cinema that emerged from this period of highly regimented film-making. One reason this was possible is that, with so many movies being made, not every one had to be a big hit. A studio could gamble on a medium-budget feature with a good script and relatively unknown actors: ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', directed by [[Orson Welles]] (1915–1985) and often regarded as the [[List of movies that have been considered the greatest ever|greatest film of all time]], fits that description. In other cases, strong-willed directors like [[Howard Hawks]] (1896–1977), [[Alfred Hitchcock]] (1899–1980) and [[Frank Capra]] (1897–1991) battled the studios in order to achieve their artistic visions. The apogee of the studio system may have been the year 1939, which saw the release of such classics as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'', ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'', ''[[Ninotchka]]'', and ''[[Midnight (1939 film)|Midnight]]''. Among the other films from the Golden Age period that are now considered to be classics: ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', the original ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', ''[[City Lights]]'', ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' and ''[[Top Hat]]''.

===Decline of the studio system===
The studio system and the Golden Age of Hollywood succumbed to two forces that developed in the late 1940s:
*a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|federal antitrust action]] that separated the production of films from their exhibition; and
*the advent of [[Television in the United States|television]].
In 1938&lt;!--Snow White's premiere was in December 1937, its release was in February 1938--&gt;, Walt Disney's ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' was released during a run of lackluster films from the major studios, and quickly became the highest-grossing film released to that point. Embarrassingly for the studios, it was an independently produced animated film that did not feature any studio-employed stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/paramountcase_1slump1938.htm|title = Part 1: The Hollywood Slump of 1938|last = Aberdeen|first = J A|date = 2005-09-06|accessdate = 2008-05-06|work = Hollywood Renegades Archive|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stoked already widespread frustration at the practice of ''[[block-booking]]'', in which studios would only sell an entire year's schedule of films at a time to theaters and use the [[vendor lock-in|lock-in]] to cover for releases of mediocre quality. Assistant Attorney General [[Thurman Arnold]]—a noted &quot;[[trust-busting|trust buster]]&quot; of the Roosevelt administration&amp;nbsp;— took this opportunity to initiate proceedings against the eight largest Hollywood studios in July 1938 for violations of the [[Sherman Anti-Trust Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;time-consent-decree&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|url = http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,849344,00.html|publisher = [[Time Magazine]]|date = 1940-11-11|accessdate = 2008-05-06|title = Consent Decree|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;part3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cobbles.com/simpp_archive/paramountcase_3consent1940.htm|title = Part 3: The Consent Decree of 1940|last = Aberdeen|first = J A|date = 2005-09-06|accessdate = 2008-05-06|work = Hollywood Renegades Archive|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal suit resulted in five of the eight studios (the &quot;Big Five&quot;: [[Warner Bros.]], [[MGM]], [[20th Century Fox|Fox]], [[RKO]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]) reaching a compromise with Arnold in October 1940 and signing a [[consent decree]] agreeing to, within three years:
*Eliminate the block-booking of short film subjects, in an arrangement known as &quot;one shot&quot;, or &quot;full force&quot; block-booking.
*Eliminate the block-booking of any more than five features in their theaters.
*No longer engage in ''blind buying'' (or the buying of films by theater districts without seeing films beforehand) and instead have ''trade-showing'', in which all 31 theater districts in US would see films every two weeks before showing movies in theaters.
*Set up an administration board in each theater district to enforce these requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-consent-decree&quot;/&gt;
The &quot;Little Three&quot; ([[Universal Studios]], [[United Artists]], and [[Columbia Pictures]]), who did not own any theaters, refused to participate in the consent decree.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-consent-decree&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;part3&quot; /&gt;
A number of independent film producers were also unhappy with the compromise and formed a union known as the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers and sued Paramount for the monopoly they still had over the Detroit Theaters&amp;nbsp;— as Paramount was also gaining dominance through actors like Bob Hope, Paulette Goddard, Veronica Lake, Betty Hutton, crooner Bing Crosby, Alan Ladd, and longtime actor for studio Gary Cooper too- by 1942. The Big Five studios didn't meet the requirements of the Consent of Decree during WWII, without major consequence, but after the war ended they joined Paramount as defendants in the Hollywood anti-trust case, as did the Little Three studios [http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/paramountcase_4equity1945.htm].
The Supreme Court eventually ruled that the major studios ownership of theaters and film distribution was a violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. As a result, the studios began to release actors and technical staff from their contracts with the studios. This changed the paradigm of film making by the major Hollywood studios, as each could have an entirely different cast and creative team. 

The decision resulted in the gradual loss of the characteristics which made [[MGM]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], [[RKO]], and [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] films immediately identifiable. Certain movie people, such as [[Cecil B. DeMille]], either remained contract artists till the end of their careers or used the same creative teams on their films, so that a DeMille film still looked like one whether it was made in 1932 or 1956. Also, the number of movies being produced annually dropped as the average budget soared, marking a major change in strategy for the industry. Studios now aimed to produce entertainment that could not be offered by television: spectacular, larger-than-life productions. Studios also began to sell portions of their theatrical film libraries to other companies to sell to television. By 1949, all major film studios had given up ownership of their theaters.

Television was also instrumental in the decline of Hollywood's Golden Age as it broke the movie industry's hegemony in American entertainment. Despite this, the film industry was also able to gain some leverage for future films as longtime government censorship faded in the 1950s. After the Paramount anti-trust case ended, Hollywood movie studios no longer owned theaters, and thus made it so foreign films could be released in American theaters without censorship. This was complemented with the 1952 [[Miracle Decision]] in the Joseph Burstyn Inc. v Wilson case, in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] reversed its earlier position, from 1915's [[Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio]] case, and stated that motion pictures were a form of art and were entitled to the protection of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First amendment]]; US laws could no longer censor films. By 1968, with film studios becoming increasingly defiant to its censorship function, the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) had replaced the Hays Code–which was now greatly violated after the government threat of censorship that justified the origin of the code had ended—with the film rating system.

===New Hollywood and post-classical cinema===

''Post-classical cinema'' is a term used to describe the changing methods of storytelling in the New Hollywood. It has been argued that new approaches to [[drama]] and characterization played upon audience expectations acquired in the classical period: chronology may be scrambled, storylines may feature &quot;[[twist ending]]s&quot;, and lines between the [[antagonist]] and [[protagonist]] may be blurred. The roots of post-classical storytelling may be seen in ''film noir'', in ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), and in Hitchcock's storyline-shattering ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.

'[[New Hollywood]]' is a term used to describe the emergence of a new generation of film school-trained directors who had absorbed the techniques developed in Europe in the 1960s; The 1967 film ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' marked the beginning of American cinema rebounding as well, as a new generation of films would afterwards gain success at the box offices as well [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/movies/12scot.html?ei=5088&amp;en=465a84ceebb54faf&amp;ex=1344571200&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all]. Filmmakers like [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[George Lucas]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Roman Polanski]], and [[William Friedkin]] came to produce fare that paid homage to the history of film, and developed upon existing genres and techniques. In the early 1970s, their films were often both critically acclaimed and commercially successful. While the early New Hollywood films like ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' and ''[[Easy Rider]]'' had been relatively low-budget affairs with amoral heroes and increased sexuality and violence, the enormous success enjoyed by Friedkin with ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] with ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', Coppola with ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', Scorsese with ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and Lucas with ''[[American Graffiti]]'', and ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', respectively helped to give rise to the modern &quot;[[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]&quot;, and induced studios to focus ever more heavily on trying to produce enormous hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Belton, John| title = American cinema/American culture| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=qDVAAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=american+cinema+american+culture&amp;dq=american+cinema+american+culture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TeYlT4jnCITw0gGpsbngCA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAA| date = 2008-11-10| publisher = McGraw-Hill| isbn = 978-0073386157| page = 384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing indulgence of these young directors did not help.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Often,{{When|date=October 2009}} they’d go overschedule, and overbudget, thus bankrupting themselves or the studio.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The three most famous examples of this are [[Francis Coppola]]’s ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' and ''[[One From The Heart]]'' and particularly [[Michael Cimino]]’s ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven’s Gate]]'', which single-handedly bankrupted [[United Artists]]. However, Coppola’s ''Apocalypse Now'' eventually made its money back and gained widespread recognition as a masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sight &amp; Sound]].

===Rise of the home video market===
The 1980s and 1990s saw another significant development. The full acceptance of [[home video]] by studios opened a vast new business to exploit. Films such as ''[[Showgirls]]'', ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' and ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', which performed poorly in their theatrical run, were now able to find success in the video market. It also saw the first generation of film makers with access to video tapes emerge. Directors such as [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[P.T. Anderson]] had been able to view thousands of films and produced films with vast numbers of references and connections to previous works. This, along with the explosion of independent film and ever-decreasing costs for filmmaking, changed the landscape of American movie-making once again, and led a renaissance of filmmaking among Hollywood's lower and middle-classes—those without access to studio financial resources. With the rise of the [[DVD]] in the 21st century, DVDs have quickly become even more profitable to studios and have led to an explosion of packaging extra scenes, extended versions, and [[audio commentary (DVD)|commentary tracks]] with the films.

===Modern cinema===

The drive to produce a spectacle on the movie screen has largely shaped American cinema ever since. Spectacular epics which took advantage of new [[widescreen]] processes had been increasingly popular from the 1950s onwards. Since then, American films have become increasingly divided into two categories: [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|Blockbusters]] and independent films. Studios have focused on relying on a handful of extremely expensive releases every year in order to remain profitable. Such blockbusters emphasize spectacle, star power, and high production value, all of which entail an enormous budget. Blockbusters typically rely upon star power and massive [[advertising]] to attract a huge audience. A successful blockbuster will attract an audience large enough to offset production costs and reap considerable profits. Such productions carry a substantial risk of failure, and most studios release blockbusters that both over- and underperform in a year. Classic blockbusters from this period include ''[[E.T.]]'', ''[[Back to the Future]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'', ''[[Top Gun]]'', ''[[Wall Street (film)| Wall Street]]'', ''[[Rain Man]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[The Green Mile]]'', ''[[Fight Club]]'', ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'', ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' and ''[[The Bourne Identity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Belton, John| title = American cinema/American culture| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=qDVAAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=american+cinema+american+culture&amp;dq=american+cinema+american+culture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TeYlT4jnCITw0gGpsbngCA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAA| date = 2008-11-10| publisher = McGraw-Hill| isbn = 978-0073386157| page = 420 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{American film industry}}

Studios supplement these movies with [[Independent film|independent productions]], made with small budgets and often independently of the studio corporation. Movies made in this manner typically emphasize high professional quality in terms of acting, directing, screenwriting, and other elements associated with production, and also upon creativity and innovation. These movies usually rely upon critical praise or niche marketing to garner an audience. Because of an independent film's low budgets, a successful independent film can have a high profit-to-cost ratio, while a failure will incur minimal losses, allowing for studios to sponsor dozens of such productions in addition to their high-stakes releases.

American independent cinema was revitalized in the late 1980s and early 1990s when another new generation of moviemakers, including [[Spike Lee]], [[Steven Soderbergh]], [[Kevin Smith]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]] made movies like, respectively: ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''; ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]''; ''[[Clerks]]''; and ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''. In terms of directing, screenwriting, editing, and other elements, these movies were innovative and often irreverent, playing with and contradicting the conventions of Hollywood movies. Furthermore, their considerable financial successes and crossover into popular culture reestablished the commercial viability of independent film. Since then, the independent film industry has become more clearly defined and more influential in American cinema. Many of the major studios have capitalised on this by developing subsidiaries to produce similar films; for example [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]].

To a lesser degree in the early 21st century, film types that were previously considered to have only a minor presence in the mainstream movie market began to arise as more potent American box office draws. These include foreign-language films such as ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' and [[documentary film]]s such as ''[[Super Size Me]]'', ''[[March of the Penguins]]'', and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''.

==Hollywood and politics==
In the 1930s the Democrats and the Republicans saw money in Hollywood. President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] saw a huge partnership with Hollywood. He used the first real potential of Hollywood’s stars in a national campaign. [[Melvyn Douglas]] toured Washington in 1939 and met the key New Dealers. Endorsements letters from leading actors were signed, radio appearances and printed advertising were made. Movie stars were used to draw a large audience into the political view of the party. By the 1960s, [[John F. Kennedy]] was a new, young face for Washington, and his strong friendship with [[Frank Sinatra]] exemplified this new era of glamor. The last moguls of Hollywood were gone and younger, newer executives and producers began generating more liberal ideas. 

Celebrities and money attracted politicians into the high-class, glittering Hollywood life-style.  As Ronald Brownstein wrote in his book “The Power and the Glitter”, television in the 1970s and 1980s was an enormously important new media in politics and Hollywood helped in that media with actors making speeches on their political beliefs, like [[Jane Fonda]] against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownstein, Ronald 1990&quot;&gt;Brownstein, Ronald (1990). ''The power and the glitter : the Hollywood-Washington connection .'' [[Pantheon Books]]. ISBN 0-394-56938-5&lt;/ref&gt; This era saw former actor [[Ronald Reagan]] became [[Governor of California]] and subsequently become President of the United States. It continued with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as California’s Governor in 2003. Today Washington’s interest is in Hollywood donations. On February 20, 2007, for example, [[Barack Obama]] had a $2300-a-plate Hollywood gala, being hosted by [[David Geffen]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] at the Beverly Hilton.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/movies/awardsseason/06holly.html|title=Politicians Are Doing Hollywood Star Turns|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|accessdate=2008-02-05 | first=David M. | last=Halbfinger | date=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood is a huge donator for presidential campaigns and this money attracts politicians. Not only is Hollywood influencing Washington with its glamour and money but Washington also influences Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;Valantin, Jean-Michel (2003). '' Hollywood, le Pentagone et Washington : les trois acteurs d'une stratégie globale.'' [[Autrement]]. ISBN 2-7467-0379-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==The American Takeover of World Markets==
In 1912, American film companies were largely immersed in the competition for the domestic market.  It was difficult to satisfy the huge demand for films created by the nickelodeon boom.  Motion Picture Patents Company members such as Edison, also sought to limit competition from French, Italian and other imported films.  However, it was obvious that a great deal of money was to be made in exporting films.  A company named Vitagraph was the first American company to open its own distribution offices in Europe.  Vitagraph had established a branch in London in 1906, and a second branch in Paris shortly after.  Other American companies were moving into foreign markets as well.  American distribution abroad continued to expand until the mid-1920s.  Originally, a majority of companies sold their films indirectly.  However, since they were inexperienced in overseas trading, they simply sold the foreign rights to their films to foreign distribution firms or export agents.  Gradually, London became a center for the international circulation of U.S. films.  Many British companies made a profit by acting as the agents for this business.  By doing this, they weakened British production by turning over a large share of the U.K. market to American films.  By 1911, approximately 60 to 70 percent of films imported into Great Britain were American.  The United States was also doing well in Germany, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Kristin|title=Film History: An Introduction|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Bublé described this song as being about his &quot;[[tongue-in-cheek]] statement on the culture of [[celebrity]],&quot; saying &quot;People will do anything for their [[15 minutes of fame|15 minutes]], and you have to remember who you are and why you wanted it.

It features Bublé walking through [[Hollywood]] and watching himself [[parody]]ing several different characters and [[celebrity|celebrities]], such as an [[astronaut]], [[James Dean]] driving his [[Porsche 550 Spyder]] numbered 130, a ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]''-esque character in a police chase driving a [[Pontiac GTO|GTO Judge]] [[muscle car]], [[Clint Eastwood]] as a [[cowboy]] in ''[[The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly]]'', and [[Justin Bieber]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's That Boy?

'''Classical Hollywood cinema''' or the '''classical Hollywood narrative''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.sandiego.edu/GEN/filmnotes/classical.html The Classic Hollywood Narrative Style] at [[University of San Diego]] History Dept&lt;/ref&gt; are terms used in [[history of film|film history]] which designate both a visual and sound style for making motion pictures and a mode of production used in the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]] between roughly the 1910s and the early 1960s.

Classical style is fundamentally built on the principle of [[continuity editing]] or &quot;invisible&quot; style. That is, the camera and the sound recording should never call attention to themselves (as they might in films from earlier periods, other countries or in a [[modernist]] or [[postmodernist]] work).

==The Golden Age==

During the Golden Age of Hollywood, which lasted from the end of the [[silent film|silent era]] in American cinema in the late 1920s to the early 1960s, movies were prolifically issued by the Hollywood studios.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/mlg/courses/definitions/classicalHollywoodcinema.html&lt;/ref&gt; The start of the Golden Age was arguably when ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' was released in 1927 and increased box-office profits for films as sound was introduced to feature films. Most Hollywood pictures adhered closely to a genre—Western, [[slapstick]] comedy, musical, animated cartoon, biopic (biographical picture)—and the same creative teams often worked on films made by the same studio. 

After ''The Jazz Singer'' was released in 1927, [[Warner Brothers]] gained huge success and was able to acquire their own string of movie theaters, after purchasing Stanley Theaters and First National Productions in 1928; MGM had also owned a string of theaters since forming in 1924, known as [[Loews Theaters]], and the [[Twentieth Century Fox|Fox film Corporation]] owned the [[Fox Theatres|Fox Theatre]] strings as well. Also, [[RKO]], another company that owned theaters, had formed in 1928 from a merger between Keith-Orpheum Theaters and the [[Radio Corporation of America]][3]. 

RKO formed in response to the monopoly Western Electric's ERPI had over sound in films as well, and began to use sound in films through their own method known as Photophone [5]. [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], who already acquired Balaban and Katz in 1926, would answer to the success of Warner Bros. and RKO, and buy a number of theaters in the late 1920s as well, before making their final purchase in 1929, through acquiring all the individual theaters belonging to the Cooperative Box Office, located in Detroit, and dominate the Detroit theaters.[4] For instance, [[Cedric Gibbons]] and [[Herbert Stothart]] always worked on MGM films, [[Alfred Newman]] worked at Twentieth Century Fox for twenty years, [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s films were almost all made at Paramount, director [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]]'s films were mostly made for Twentieth-Century Fox, etc. 

Movie making was still a business, however, and motion picture companies made money by operating under the [[studio system]]. The major studios kept thousands of people on salary—actors, producers, directors, writers, stunt men, craftspersons, and technicians. And they owned hundreds of theaters in cities and towns across America, theaters that showed their films and that were always in need of fresh material. In 1930, [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPDDA]] President [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]] also founded the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays (Production) Code]], which followed [[censorship]] guidelines and went into effect after government threats of censorship expanded by 1930. [6] However the code was never enforced until 1934, after the new Catholic Church organization The [[Legion of Decency]] - appalled by [[Mae West]]'s very successful sexual appearances in ''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'' and ''[[I'm No Angel]]'' [7]- threatened a boycott of motion pictures if it did not go into effect [8], and those that didn't obtain a seal of approval from the [[Production Code Administration]] had to pay a $25,000 fine and could not profit in the theaters, as the MPDDA owned every theater in the country through the Big Five studios [9]. 

Throughout the early 1930s, risque films and salacious advertising, became widespread in the short period known as [[Pre-Code Hollywood]]. MGM dominated the industry and had the top stars in Hollywood, and was also credited for creating the Hollywood star system altogether[10]. MGM stars included at various times &quot;King of Hollywood&quot; [[Clark Gable]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Ava Gardner]], [[James Stewart]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Grace Kelly]], [[Gene Kelly]], [[Gloria Stuart]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[John Wayne]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Buster Keaton]]  [11]. Another great achievement of American cinema during this era came through [[Walt Disney]]'s animation. In 1937, Disney created the most successful film of its time, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' [12].

Many film historians have remarked upon the many great works of cinema that emerged from this period of highly regimented film-making. One reason this was possible is that, with so many movies being made, not every one had to be a big hit. A studio could gamble on a medium-budget feature with a good script and relatively unknown actors: ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', directed by [[Orson Welles]] and often regarded as the greatest film of all time, fits that description. In other cases, strong-willed directors like [[Howard Hawks]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Frank Capra]]  battled the studios in order to achieve their artistic visions. The apogee of the studio system may have been the year 1939, which saw the release of such classics as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', ''[[Young Mr. Lincoln]]'', ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'', ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'', ''[[Ninotchka]]'', ''[[Gunga Din (film)| Gunga Din]]'', and ''[[The Roaring Twenties]]''. Among the other films from the Golden Age period that are now considered to be classics: ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'', ''[[All About Eve]]'', ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'', ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast At Tiffany's]]'', ''[[North by Northwest]]'', ''[[Dinner at Eight (film)|Dinner at Eight]]'', ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', ''[[City Lights]]'', ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', ''[[The Bishop's Wife]]'', ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'', ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]], and ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]''.

==Style==
The style of Classical Hollywood cinema, as elaborated by [[David Bordwell]],&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David; Staiger, Janet; Thompson, Kristin (1985): The Classical Hollywood Cinema. Film Style &amp; Mode of Production to 1960. New York: Columbia University Press. 1-59&lt;/ref&gt; has been heavily influenced by the ideas of the [[Renaissance]] and its resurgence of mankind as the focal point.

Thus, classical narration progresses always through psychological motivation, i.e. by the will of a human character and its struggle with obstacles towards a defined goal. The aspects of space and time are subordinated to the narrative element which is usually composed of two lines of action: A romance intertwined with a more generic one such as business or, in the case of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films, solving a crime.

Time in classical Hollywood is continuous, since [[Nonlinear narrative|non-linearity]] calls attention to the illusory workings of the medium. The only permissible manipulation of time in this format is the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]. It is mostly used to introduce a memory sequence of a character, e.g. ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''.

Likewise, the treatment of space in classic Hollywood strives to overcome or conceal the two-dimensionality of film (&quot;invisible style&quot;) and is strongly centered upon the human body. The majority of shots in a classical film focus on [[gesture]]s or [[facial expression]]s (medium-long and [[medium shot]]s). [[André Bazin]] once compared classical film to a photographed play in that the events seem to exist objectively and that cameras only give us the best view of the whole play.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell: 24&lt;/ref&gt;

This treatment of space consists of four main aspects: centering, balancing, frontality and depth. Persons or objects of significance are mostly in the center part of the picture [[Film frame|frame]] and never out of focus. Balancing refers to the visual composition, i.e. characters are evenly distributed throughout the frame. The action is subtly addressed towards the spectator (frontality) and [[Set construction|set]], lighting (mostly [[three-point lighting]]) and costumes are designed to separate foreground from the background (depth).

The characters in Classical Hollywood Cinema typically are the causal agents.  They also have clearly definable traits.  They are active and goal oriented.

==Production==
The mode of production came to be known as the [[studio system|Hollywood studio system]] and the [[star system (film)|star system]], which standardized the way movies were produced.  All film workers (actors, directors, etc.) were employees of a particular [[film studio]]. This resulted in a certain uniformity to film style: directors were encouraged to think of themselves as employees rather than artists, and hence [[auteur]]s did not flourish (although some directors, such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[John Ford]], [[Howard Hawks]] and [[Orson Welles]], worked within this system and still fulfilled their artistic selves).

==Periodization==
While the boundaries are vague, the Classical era is generally held to begin in 1927 with the release of ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]''. Hollywood classicism gradually declined with the collapse of the studio system, the advent of television, the growing popularity of auteurism among directors, and the increasing influence of foreign films and [[independent film]]making. 

The [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|1948 U.S. Supreme Court decision]], which outlawed the practice of [[block booking]] and the above-mentioned ownership and operation of theater chains by the major film studios (as it was believed to constitute anti-competitive and monopolistic trade practices) was seen as a major blow to the studio system. This was because it firstly cleared the way for a growing number of independent producers (some of them the actors themselves) and studios to produce their film product free of major studio interference, and secondly because it destroyed the original business model utilized by the studios who struggled to adapt.&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.mises.org/daily/3437&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;At the time of the Court decision, everyone said the quality, consistency, and availability of movies would go up and prices would fall. Quite the opposite happened. By 1955, the number of produced films had fallen by 25 percent. More than 4,200 theaters (or 23 percent of the total) had shut their doors. More than half of those remaining were unable to earn a profit. They could not afford to rent and exhibit the best and most costly films, the ones most likely to compete with television.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.mises.org/daily/3437&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;'''Hollywood'''&quot; is a song recorded by American recording artist [[Jay-Z]] for his ninth studio album, ''[[Kingdom Come (Jay-Z album)|Kingdom Come]]'' (2006). The song features Jay-Z's now-wife, American recording artist [[Beyoncé Knowles]]. It was composed by Jay-Z, [[Ne-Yo|Shaffer Smith]], and [[Syience|Reggie &quot;Syience&quot; Perry]]. &quot;Hollywood&quot; is a [[disco music|disco]]-influenced R&amp;B song with lyrics that detail the tiredness music stars, working in the [[cinema of the United States|American cinema]] industry, sometimes feel.

The song was generally well received by music critics who praised its musical arrangement as well as the guest vocals by Knowles. Even without a proper official release, &quot;Hollywood&quot; charted on a few US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' component charts]], reaching a peak of number 56 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart in early March 2007. It also gained attention in Australia where it charted inside the top 100 positions of the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Singles Chart]]. 

Knowles later recorded a solo version of the song, which was re-titled &quot;Welcome to Hollywood&quot;, and included it on the deluxe edition of her second studio album, ''[[B'Day]]'' (2006). A video interlude was recorded for [[The Beyoncé Experience]] tour where clips of Knowles were shown and music videos from her ''B'Day Anthology'' were comprised together, while the song was played on the tour.

==Beyoncé Knowles' solo version==

Jay-Z's outro verse was also re-recorded by Beyoncé as well. The chorus still features Jay-Z in the background. This version was included on Knowles' 2007 live album, ''[[The Beyoncé Experience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001GSB7SE |title=Welcome To Hollywood (Audio from The Beyonce Experience Live) |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon UK]].

Amazon Inc |accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video interlude was recorded for [[The Beyoncé Experience]] tour where clips of Knowles were shown and music videos from her ''B'Day Anthology'' were comprised together. The video also shows video clips of Beyoncé behind the scenes of photo shoots and commercials and red carpet events with fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Beyoncé Knowles|title=[[The Beyoncé Experience Live]]|date=2007|publisher=[[Columbia Records]]|medium=|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Welcome to Hollywood&quot; was included as the 31st track on Knowles' live album, ''[[The Beyoncé Experience Live]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/be/album/the-beyonce-experience-live/id268305666 |title=The Beyoncé Experience (Live) [Audio Version] |language=Dutch |publisher=[[iTunes Store|Itunes Belgim]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2513">'''Hollywood''' is an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] in the southern portion of [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Abington Township]], [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].  It is well known for its collection of [[Southern California]]-style homes.

The 174-home neighborhood got its start when a builder from [[California]], Gustav Weber filed plans to build a small subdivision in 1928.  The homes were built in pastel colors with flat roofs, similar to Spanish-style homes in the [[Los Angeles]] area.  Streets were named Los Angeles, San Diego, Pasadena and San Gabriel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abington's sliver of Tinseltown&quot;&gt;[http://www.macon.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/states/pennsylvania/counties/montgomery_county/16849854.htm?source=rss&amp;channel=inquirer_montgomery_county Abington's sliver of Tinseltown].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one of Weber's problems was that the neighborhood was not built to cope with the Northeastern winters.  Plants native to Southern California and moravian tile sidewalks were included in his plans.  The plants died in the cold.  Homes were not insulated and could not withstand the cold.  The flat roofs leaked.  The tile cracked and was replaced by concrete.  As a result significant modifications were made to the homes since they were built.

The neighborhood was never finished according to Weber's plans.  Possible reasons ranged from the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]] to an unfaithful wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abington's sliver of Tinseltown&quot;/&gt;  A local developer ended up finishing the development in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://department.bloomu.edu/geo/msd/Abstracts2004.pdf Landscape Change in Hollywood, Pennsylvania, Wayne Brew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]] has listed the area as eligible for national registry.  As a result, residents can apply for federal grants to maintain the historical character of the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/view.php?id=6747 Philadelphia Weekly, Letter to the Editor]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Real World: Hollywood''''' is the twentieth season of [[MTV]]'s [[reality television]] series ''[[The Real World]]'', which focuses on a group of diverse strangers living together for several months in a different city each season, as cameras document their lives and interpersonal relationships. It premiered on April 16, 2008. Its season finale was broadcast July 9, 2008, and a reunion special was broadcast live on July 12, 2008.

This is the fourth season to be set in a [[Hollywood, California|California city]] after the [[The Real World: Los Angeles|Los Angeles]], [[The Real World: San Francisco|San Francisco]], and [[The Real World: San Diego|San Diego]] seasons, making California the most commonly used state to be used for as a setting for the series.

Comedian [[Andy Dick]] guest appears in Episode 3, when the cast begins their work at the Hollywood comedy club [[iO WEST]].

==Season changes==
Previous seasons were aired as half-hour episodes. This season is the first to be aired as 13 one-hour episodes, a move that is credited as helping MTV rank as the #1 network in the Wednesday 10pm - 11pm time slot among people age 12-34. MTV continued with this format with the following seasons. MTV has also supplemented the airings with The Real World Dailies, an online series of unaired production footage launched in mid-April 2008 that, as of May 13, 2008, amassed 3 million hits by nearly 400,000 unique visitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer&quot;&gt;[http://www.observer.com/2008/real-world-brooklyn-real Sicha, Choire; &quot;The Real World: Brooklyn. For Real.&quot; observer.com; May 13, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realworlddailies.com/ ''The Real World Dailies'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Real World: Hollywood'' marathon hosted by [[Coral Smith]] of ''[[The Real World: Back to New York]]'' was aired July 4, 2008. It featured commentary by Smith and other alumni of ''[[The Real World]]'' and ''[[Road Rules]]'', referred to as &quot;CoralVision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchingrealitytv.com/real-world-hollywood-marathon/ Real World Hollywood Marathon] at watchingrealitytv.com. July 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

MTV also aired ''The Sunny Side of Truth'' encore special, which features pop-up comments from characters from the Sunny Side of Truth, an anti-tobacco organization. Because a recurring theme of this season involves cast members talking about their struggles with drug and alcohol addiction, the comments often have a drug-abstinence message.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/asm/american_legacy/truth/ &quot;The Sunny Side of MTV&quot;; mtv.com; July 4, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratings==
For the first four weeks, the season posted a 2.5 rating among people 12-34, a 14% increase from the prior season-to-date. The season also saw growth among females 18-24 with a 6.1 rating, a 39% increase over the previous year. The season made MTV the #1 network for the Wednesday 10pm - 11pm time slot among people 12-34, exceeding even broadcast networks for the same demographic. As of May 13, 2008, the season reached 44 million viewers, 23 million of which are in the network's 12-34 target demographic core.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer&quot;/&gt;

==Assignment==
Almost every season of ''The Real World'', beginning with its [[The Real World: Miami|fifth season]], has included the assignment of a season-long group job or task to the housemates, continued participation in which has been mandatory to remain part of the cast since the [[Back to New York]] season. The Hollywood cast was assigned to take [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] comedy classes at [[iO WEST]], a comedy club in [[Hollywood]]. The cast names their group WTF, which ostensibly stands for Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, but [[subtext]]ually stands for &quot;What the Fuck&quot;, which cast member Dave Malinosky explains in Episode 8 is the reaction the cast predicted they would invoke in their audience.

==The residence==

Among the relationships discussed were Dave and Kimberly, Joey and Brianna, Sarah's revelation that she was now engaged, the triangle between Will, Janelle and Brittini, and the subsequent foursome involving Will, Dave and two women. Present during the taping was Janelle herself, who took to the stage to air her criticisms of Will's behavior.&lt;ref name=Reunion/&gt;

In January 2010, Joey, spurred by the impending birth of his and his girlfriend's child, appeared on the third season of ''[[Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew]]'', where he sought help for his addiction to [[cocaine]], [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] and [[alcohol]].&lt;ref name=Rehab/&gt; After completing treatment, he indicated that after helping his girlfriend, Nikki,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vh1.com/video/celebrity-rehab-3/full-episodes/new-patients/1630618/playlist.jhtml Video of ''Celebrity Rehab'' Episode 3.4 (&quot;New Patients&quot;) at VH1.com]&lt;/ref&gt; move into their new home, he would get a sponsor, go to meetings, and go to a [[sober living]] facility.&lt;ref name=Season3Finale&gt;[http://www.vh1.com/video/celebrity-rehab-3/full-episodes/graduation/1632981/playlist.jhtml Video of ''Celebrity Rehab'' Episode 3.9 (&quot;Graduation&quot;) at VH1.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hollywood Road''' is a street in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Sheung Wan]], on [[Hong Kong Island]], [[Hong Kong]].

Hollywood Road is filled with trinket and antique shops of all sorts: from [[China|Chinese]] furniture to porcelain ware, from [[Buddharupa|Buddha sculpture]]s to [[Tibet]]an rugs, from Japanese [[netsuke]]s to [[Coromandel screen]]s, from [[Ming dynasty]] ceramic horsemen and kitsch [[Mao Zedong|Maoist]] memorabilia. The street runs between [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Sheung Wan]], with [[Wyndham Street]], [[Arbuthnot Road]], [[Ladder Street]], [[Upper Lascar Row]], and [[Old Bailey Street]] in the vicinity.

Hollywood Road was the second road to be built when the colony of Hong Kong was founded, after [[Queen's Road Central]]. It was the first to be completed.  The Man Mo Temple was a place for trial in very early years.

==Name==
Hollywood Road was put up early in 1844, before the more famous [[Hollywood]] in [[California]] was settled. It was probably named by Sir [[John Francis Davis]], the second [[Governor of Hong Kong]], after his family home at [[Westbury-on-Trym]], near Bristol, England.&lt;ref name=&quot;streets&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Streets: exploring Hong Kong Island|last= Wordie|first= Jason|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2002|publisher= [[Hong Kong University Press]]|location= |isbn= 9789622095632|page= 41|pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another origin mentioned for the name is that holly shrubs were growing in the area when the road was constructed. Such plants were not indigenous to the area and would have been imported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Hong Kong: A Cultural History|last= Ingham|first= Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2007|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|location= |isbn= 9780195314960|page= 96|pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Like most major roads in the early years of the colony, Hollywood Road was built by the [[Royal Engineers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;streets&quot;/&gt; More than 100 years ago, Hollywood Road was rather close to the coastline. In those days, foreign merchants and sailors would put up the antiques and artefacts they &quot;collected&quot; from China for sale here on their way back to Europe. This is how Hollywood Road began its role as an antique market. The 1960 Hollywood film ''[[The World of Suzie Wong]]'' was shot in part in Hollywood Road. An old wood-built building was re-constructed as a bar for the movie.

===The Union Church===
There was a [[Union Church, Hong Kong|Union Church]] in the street founded in 1844 by the [[James Legge|Reverend James Legge]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[missionary]] who had been sent to Hong Kong in 1843 by the [[London Missionary Society]]. The first Union Church was built in 1845 on Hollywood Road above Central. Every Sunday an English language service was held in the morning and a Chinese language service in the afternoon. The Church was later relocated to a new site on [[Staunton Street]].

==Features==
===Man Mo Temple===
[[Man Mo Temple]] or Man Mo Miu (文武廟) is a commonly sort of temple worshipping the Man Tai (文帝), [[Pau Kung]] and Mo Tai (武帝), [[Kwan Yu]], to pray for good results in examinations in China.  The one on the Hollywood Road was built in 1847. It has been managed by [[Tung Wah Group of Hospitals]] since 1908. It is it is a [[declared monuments of Hong Kong|declared monument]].&lt;ref&gt;Antiquities and Monuments Office. [http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/en/monuments_96.php Man Mo Temple Compound, Hollywood Road, Sheung Wan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Police Station===
{{main|Central Police Station}}
Central Police Station was the first police station in Hong Kong. The oldest structure within the compound is a barrack block built in 1864. It is a three-storey building constructed alongside Victoria Prison (see below). A storey was later added to the mass in 1905. In 1919, Headquarters Block facing Hollywood Road was constructed. Subsequently in 1925, the two-storey Stable Block was constructed at the northwest end of the procession ground and later used as a munitions store. The Police Station accompanied by the former Central Magistracy and Victoria Prison form a group of historical architecture representing law and order in Hong Kong.

===Hollywood Road Art District===
Previously known solely for antique shops, Hollywood Road has recently developed into a [[contemporary art]] district in Hong Kong.  The first gallery to open was Plum Blossoms in 1987.  It was followed by the opening of Connoisseur Art Gallery in 1989 and Zee Stone Gallery in 1991.  Para/Site Art Space, the first [[non-profit]] in the area, moved to Sheung Wan in 1997.  2000 brought the opening of the [[Asia Art Archive]], another non-profit, followed by the opening of Grotto Fine Art and the Yan Gallery.  The established Schoeni Gallery opened a branch on Hollywood Rd in 2001.  The mid to late 2000s saw the opening of many galleries in the area including Amelia Johnson Contemporary, Cat Street Galleries, Gallery Exit, Input/Output, Sin Sin Fine Art,  and the Hong Kong branches of CAIS, Sundaram Tagore, and Tang Contemporary.

'''Universal Studios Hollywood''' is a [[movie studio]] and [[Amusement park|theme park]] in the [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Universal City, California|Universal City]] community of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. It is one of the oldest and most famous Hollywood movie studios still in use. Its official marketing headline is &quot;The Entertainment Capital of LA&quot;, though during the summer it is often advertised as &quot;The Coolest Place in LA.&quot; It was initially created to offer tours of the real Universal Studios soundstages and sets. It is the first of many full-fledged [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts|Universal Studios Theme Parks]] located across the world. [[Woody Woodpecker]] is the mascot for Universal Studios Hollywood.

Outside the theme park, Universal City includes hotels Universal [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] &amp; Towers, the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts]], the multi-screen Globe Theatre, often used for banquets and receptions, and [[Universal CityWalk]], which offers a collection of shops and restaurants, as well as the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]], a concert venue.

==History==
[[File:Universal Studios Fountain.jpg|thumb|Fountain at park entrance]]

===The first studio tour===
From the beginning, [[Universal Studios|Universal]] has offered tours of its studio.  In the [[silent film]] days, [[Carl Laemmle]]'s tour included a chance to buy fresh produce, since then-rural Universal City was still in part a working farm.  This original tour was discontinued in the early 1930s due to the advent of sound films coming to Universal.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - History&quot; /&gt;

===The arrival of Universal Studios Hollywood===
Shortly after [[Music Corporation of America]] took over Universal Pictures in 1962, accountants suggested a new tour in the studio commissary would increase profits. In 1964, the modern tour was established to include a series of dressing room walk-throughs, peeks at actual production, and later, staged events.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - History&quot; /&gt; This grew over the years into a full-blown [[amusement park|theme park]]. The narrated tram tour (formerly &quot;GlamorTrams&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;GlamourTrams&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=GlamourTrams|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/studiotour/glamortrams.shtml|publisher=The Studio Tour|accessdate=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) still runs through the studio's active [[backlot]], but the staged events, [[stunt]] demonstrations and high-tech rides overshadow the motion-picture production that once lured fans to Universal Studios Hollywood.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - History&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Studio Tour History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Studio Tour|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/attractions/studiotour.shtml|publisher=The Studio Tour|accessdate=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backlot fires===
{{Wikinews|Fire in Universal Studios backlot}}
[[File:Universal Fire Smoke.jpg|thumb|Smoke during the 2008 fire. The Courthouse facade is visible to the left of the smoke plume.]]
Universal Studios Hollywood's backlot has been damaged by fire 8 times throughout its history.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - Fires&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Backlot Fires|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fires.shtml|publisher=The Studio Tour|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was in 1932 when embers from a nearby [[bushfire]] were blown towards the backlot causing 4 movie sets to be destroyed causing over $100,000 damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - Fires - 1932&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= Actors Flee Blazing Movie Set|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1932.shtml|publisher=The Studio Tour|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen years later in 1949 another bushfire caused the complete destruction of one building and damage to two others.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - Fires - 1949&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Southland Fires Halted|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1949.shtml|publisher=The Studio Tour|accessdate=9 July 2010|author=Long Beach Independent|date=22 June 1949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, the New York street film studio set was destroyed by an [[arson]] fire causing half a million dollars damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - Fires - 1957&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=1957 Backlot Fire|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1957.shtml|publisher=The Studio Tour|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, in 1967, twice as much damage was done when the Little Europe area and part of Spartacus Square was destroyed. It also destroyed the European, Denver and Laramie street sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - Fires - 1967&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=1967 Backlot Fire|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1967.shtml|publisher=The Studio Tour|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the remaining portion of Spartacus Square was destroyed along with street sets and other buildings. As with the 1957 fire, this was suspected to be the result of an arsonist.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - Fires - 1987&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=1987 Backlot Fire|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1987.shtml|publisher=The Studio Tour|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just three years later another deliberate fire was started in the backlot. The New York Street set, the Ben Hur set and the majority of [[Courthouse Square]] was destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - Fires - 1990&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=1990 Backlot Fire|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1990.shtml|publisher=The Studio Tour|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the seventh fire occurred at the backlot.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - Fires&quot; /&gt; A portion of the Courthouse Square was again destroyed leaving the Courthouse itself to live another day.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - Fires -  1997&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=1997 Backlot Fire|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1997.shtml|publisher=The Studio Tour|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most damage was done on June 1, 2008 when a [[Multiple-alarm fire|three alarm fire]] broke out on the backlot of Universal Studios. The fire started when a worker using an acetylene torch for welding accidentally let it catch fire with the surroundings.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Studio Tour - Fire - 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=USH 2008 Fire|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/wiki/index.php?title=USH_2008_Fire|publisher=The Studio Tour|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/06/01/studio.fire/index.html |title=Universal Studios blaze burns sets, video vault |accessdate=2008-06-13 | work=CNN | date=June 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Los Angeles County Fire Department had reported that Brownstone Street, New York Street, New England Street, the King Kong attraction, some structures that make up Courthouse Square, and the Video Vault had burned down (not to be confused with the actual Film Vault, The Video Vault contains the duplicates of the films). Aerial news footage showed the miraculous survival of the Courthouse building survived the fire (for a third time) with only the west side of it being slightly charred. Over 516 fire-fighters&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;/&gt; from various local fire departments, as well as two helicopters dropping water, had responded to the fire. Fourteen fire-fighters and three Los Angeles County sheriffs' deputies sustained minor injuries. The fire was finally put out after 12 hours, since fire-fighters encountered low water pressure.

Destroyed were 40,000 to 50,000 archived digital video and film copies chronicling Universal's movie and TV classic shows, dating back to the 1920s, including the films ''[[Knocked Up]]'' and ''[[Atonement (film)|Atonement]]'', the [[NBC]] series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', and ''[[Miami Vice]]'', and [[CBS]]'s ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/us/01cnd-fire.html?ref=movies|title=Large Fire Strikes Universal Studio Lot | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Cieply | date=June 1, 2008 | accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ieKlEB60J43hDZ39AB9VmsPZ72sgD911MNN80  |first=Greg |last=Risling |publisher=Web Archive |title=Fire at Universal Studios destroys sets, videos |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080604141631/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ieKlEB60J43hDZ39AB9VmsPZ72sgD911MNN80 |archivedate = 2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-studio-fire,0,5322600.story  |title=Universal studios fire may cost tens of millions |accessdate=2008-06-13 |first=Ryan |last=Nakashima |publisher=Web Archive |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080605022828/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-studio-fire,0,5322600.story |archivedate = 2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many audio master tapes from Universal Music have been destroyed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.websitetoolbox.com/tool/post/bsnpubs/show_single_post?pid=28592808&amp;postcount=77 |title=Both Sides Now Stereo Chat Board |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universal president Ron Meyer stated that nothing irreplaceable was lost, meaning everything will be rebuilt again, at a price of at least $50 million. Days after the fire, however, it was reported that the King Kong attraction would not be rebuilt and would eventually be replaced by a new attraction that had yet to be announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://travel.latimes.com/daily-deal-blog/index.php/universal-studios-hollywood-to-replace-king-kong-with-new-attraction-1977  |title=Universal Studios Hollywood to replace ‘King Kong’ with new attraction | work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, Universal changed its position and decided to rebuild the [[King Kong: 360 3-D|King Kong attraction]], basing the new attraction on the [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 film adaptation]].
