==Unreferenced BLPs==
[[File:Information.svg|30px]] Hello Zakko! Thank you for your contributions. I am a [[WP:BOT|bot]] alerting you that '''1''' of the articles that you created   is tagged as an[[Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Sources| Unreferenced Biography of a Living Person]]. The [[WP:BLP|biographies of living persons]] policy requires that all personal or potentially controversial information be sourced. In addition, to ensure [[WP:VERRIFY|verifiability]], all biographies should be based on [[WP:RELIABLE|reliable sources]]. If you were to bring this article up to standards, it would greatly help us with the current ''[[:Category:All_unreferenced_BLPs|{{PAGESINCATEGORY:All_unreferenced_BLPs}}]]'' article backlog. Once the article is adequately referenced, please remove the {{tl|unreferencedBLP}} tag. Here is the article:

# [[Peter Lipa]] - &lt;small&gt;{{findsources|Peter Lipa}}&lt;/small&gt;
